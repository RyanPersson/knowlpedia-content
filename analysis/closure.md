title: "Closure"
description: "The smallest closed set containing a given set, equivalently points arbitrarily close to it."
---

Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} and let $A\subseteq X$. The **closure** of $A$, denoted $\overline{A}$ (or $\operatorname{cl}(A)$), is the set
$$
\overline{A}:=\{x\in X : \forall r>0,\ B(x,r)\cap A\neq\varnothing\}.
$$
Equivalently, $\overline{A}$ is the intersection of all {{< knowl id="closed-set" text="closed sets" >}} that contain $A$.

The closure adds to $A$ all points that can be approximated arbitrarily well by points of $A$. It is fundamental for {{< knowl id="dense-subset" text="density" >}}, {{< knowl id="limit-point-accumulation-point-cluster-point" text="limit points" >}}, and topological convergence.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$, $\overline{(0,1)}=[0,1]$.
- In $\mathbb{R}$, $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}=\mathbb{R}$ (rationals are dense).
- If $A$ is closed, then $\overline{A}=A$.
