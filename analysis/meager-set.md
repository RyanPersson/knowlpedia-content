Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}}. A set $M\subseteq X$ is **meager** (or **of first category**) if there exist {{< knowl id="nowhere-dense-set" text="nowhere dense" >}} sets $A_1,A_2,\dots\subseteq X$ such that
$
M=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n.
$

Meager sets are "topologically small." The Baire category theorem says that {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space" text="complete metric spaces" >}} cannot be meager in themselves, which yields strong "generic" existence statements.

**Examples:**
- Any countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is meager, since a singleton $\{x\}$ is nowhere dense and a countable set is a countable union of singletons.
- $\mathbb{Q}$ is meager in $\mathbb{R}$ (it is countable).
- A meager set can be dense: $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense but meager in $\mathbb{R}$.
