Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" text="metric space" >}} and let $K\subseteq X$. The set $K$ is **compact** if for every family of {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open sets" >}} $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ in $X$ such that
$$K\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i,$$
there exist finitely many indices $i_1,\dots,i_N\in I$ such that
$$K\subseteq U_{i_1}\cup\cdots\cup U_{i_N}.$$

Compactness is a finiteness condition on the topology. In analysis it is the hypothesis behind {{< knowl id="uniform-continuity" text="uniform continuity" >}} (Heine–Cantor), attainment of extrema (Extreme Value Theorem), and many extraction arguments (existence of convergent {{< knowl id="subsequence" text="subsequences" >}}).

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric, $[a,b]$ is compact.
- In $\mathbb{R}^k$, every closed ball $\overline{B}(0,R)$ is compact (Heine–Borel).
- The open interval $(0,1)\subset\mathbb{R}$ is not compact (cover it by $(0,1-\tfrac1n)$ for $n\ge 2$; no finite subcover).
