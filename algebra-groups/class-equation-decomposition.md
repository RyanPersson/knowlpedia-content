**Proposition (Decomposition underlying the class equation).**
Let $G$ be a finite {{< knowl id="group" text="group" >}}. Consider the action of $G$ on itself by conjugation (see {{< knowl id="conjugation-action-self" text="conjugation action" >}}). Then:

1. $G$ is a disjoint union of its conjugacy classes.
2. The elements with singleton conjugacy class are exactly the {{< knowl id="center-of-group" text="center" >}} $Z(G)$.
3. For each $x\in G$, the size of the conjugacy class of $x$ equals the index $[G:C_G(x)]$, where $C_G(x)$ is the {{< knowl id="centralizer" text="centralizer" >}}, and this is a consequence of the {{< knowl id="orbit-stabilizer-theorem" text="orbit–stabilizer theorem" >}}.

In particular, choosing one representative $x_i$ from each conjugacy class outside the center yields the decomposition
$$
|G| \;=\; |Z(G)| \;+\; \sum_i [G:C_G(x_i)].
$$

**Context.**
This is the structural content behind the {{< knowl id="class-equation" text="class equation" >}}: it turns the conjugation action into a counting identity, a key tool for $p$-groups and Sylow theory.
