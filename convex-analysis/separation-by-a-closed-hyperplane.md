title: "Separation by a Closed Hyperplane"
description: "Separation using a nonzero continuous functional in the dual space."

Let $X$ be a real {{< knowl id="norm-normed-vector-space" text="normed space" >}} and let $\Omega_1,\Omega_2\subset X$ be nonempty.

We say that $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ can be **separated by a closed hyperplane** if there exists a nonzero functional $x^\ast \in X^\ast$ (see {{< knowl id="dual-space-and-duality-pairing" text="dual space" >}}) such that
$$
\langle x^\ast ,x\rangle \le \langle x^\ast ,y\rangle \quad\text{whenever }x\in\Omega_1,\ y\in\Omega_2.
$$

Here "closed {{< knowl id="hyperplane" text="hyperplane" >}}" emphasizes that $x^\ast $ is continuous, so each level set $\{x\mid \langle x^\ast ,x\rangle=\alpha\}$ is {{< knowl id="closed-subset" text="closed" >}}; see {{< knowl id="continuity-of-linear-functionals-via-closed-level-sets" text="continuity via closed level sets" >}}.
