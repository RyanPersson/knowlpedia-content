A **Cauchy sequence** in a metric space $(X,d)$ is a sequence $(x_n)$ such that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $N$ with $d(x_m,x_n)<\varepsilon$ for all $m,n\ge N$.

Every {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" text="convergent sequence" >}} is Cauchy (see {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence-is-cauchy" text="convergent implies Cauchy" >}}), and every Cauchy sequence is {{< knowl id="bounded-set" text="bounded" >}} (see {{< knowl id="every-cauchy-sequence-is-bounded" text="Cauchy implies bounded" >}}). Cauchy sequences converge precisely in a {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space" text="complete metric space" >}}.

**Examples:**
- In $\mathbb{Q}$ with the usual metric, a sequence of rational approximations to $\sqrt{2}$ is Cauchy but does not converge in $\mathbb{Q}$ (its limit lies in $\mathbb{R}$), illustrating non-completeness.
