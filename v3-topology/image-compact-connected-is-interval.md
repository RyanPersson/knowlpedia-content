**Image of a compact connected set is an interval:** Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="topological-space" section="topology-core" text="topological space" >}}, let $K\subseteq X$ be {{< knowl id="compact-set" section="topology-compactness" text="compact" >}} and {{< knowl id="connected-set" text="connected" >}}, and let $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$ be a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" section="topology-core" text="continuous map" >}}. Then $f(K)$ is a compact interval in $\mathbb{R}$; in particular, there exist real numbers $m\le M$ such that $f(K)=[m,M]$.

This follows by combining {{< knowl id="continuous-image-of-compact-set-is-compact" section="topology-compactness" text="continuous images of compact sets are compact" >}} with {{< knowl id="continuous-image-of-connected-set-is-connected" text="continuous images of connected sets are connected" >}} and {{< knowl id="connected-subsets-of-r-are-intervals" text="connected subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ being intervals" >}} (and $f(K)$ is the {{< knowl id="image" section="shared-foundations" text="image" >}} of $K$ under $f$).
