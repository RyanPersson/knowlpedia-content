Let $X$ be a {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological space" >}} and let $q:X\to Y$ be a {{< knowl id="surjective-function" section="shared-foundations" text="surjective function" >}}. The **quotient topology** on $Y$ is defined by declaring a subset $U\subseteq Y$ to be {{< knowl id="open-set" text="open" >}} if and only if the {{< knowl id="preimage" section="shared-foundations" text="preimage" >}} $q^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.

With this topology, $q$ is automatically a {{< knowl id="continuous-map" text="continuous map" >}}; a surjection equipped with this property is often called a *quotient map*. A common source of quotient topologies is an {{< knowl id="equivalence-relation" section="shared-foundations" text="equivalence relation" >}} $\sim$ on $X$, where $Y$ is the {{< knowl id="quotient-set" section="shared-foundations" text="quotient set" >}} $X/{\sim}$ and $q$ is the canonical projection.
