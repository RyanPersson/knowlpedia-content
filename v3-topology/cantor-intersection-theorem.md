**Cantor intersection theorem:** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="complete-metric-space" text="complete metric space" >}} and let $(F_n)$ be a sequence of nonempty {{< knowl id="closed-set" section="topology-core" text="closed sets" >}} such that $F_{n+1}\subseteq F_n$ for all $n$. If $\operatorname{diam}(F_n)\to 0$ (where $\operatorname{diam}$ is the {{< knowl id="diameter" text="diameter" >}}), then
\[
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty F_n
\]
consists of exactly one point.

This theorem is a metric-space generalization of the {{< knowl id="nested-interval-theorem" text="nested interval theorem" >}} and is a standard tool for working with completeness via shrinking closed sets.
