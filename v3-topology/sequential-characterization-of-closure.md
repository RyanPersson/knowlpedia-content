**Sequential characterization of closure (metric spaces):** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" section="topology-metric" text="metric space" >}}, let $A\subseteq X$, and let $x\in X$. Then $x$ lies in the {{< knowl id="closure" section="topology-core" text="closure" >}} of $A$ if and only if there exists a sequence $(a_n)$ in $A$ such that $(a_n)$ {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" section="topology-metric" text="converges" >}} to $x$.

Equivalently, $\overline{A}$ is exactly the set of all {{< knowl id="limit-of-a-sequence" section="topology-metric" text="limits of sequences" >}} whose terms lie in $A$. Applying this with $A=F$ recovers the {{< knowl id="sequential-characterization-of-closed-sets" text="sequential characterization of closed sets" >}}.
