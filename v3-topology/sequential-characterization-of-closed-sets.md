**Sequential characterization of closed sets (metric spaces):** Let $(X,d)$ be a {{< knowl id="metric-space" section="topology-metric" text="metric space" >}} and let $F\subseteq X$. Then $F$ is a {{< knowl id="closed-set" section="topology-core" text="closed set" >}} in $X$ if and only if, whenever a sequence $(x_n)$ in $F$ {{< knowl id="limit-of-a-sequence" section="topology-metric" text="converges to a limit" >}} $x$ in $X$, one has $x\in F$.

This criterion often lets one verify closedness using {{< knowl id="convergent-sequence" section="topology-metric" text="convergent sequences" >}} instead of working directly with complements of {{< knowl id="open-set" section="topology-core" text="open sets" >}}. Combined with the {{< knowl id="sequential-characterization-of-closure" text="sequential characterization of closure" >}}, it identifies closed sets as those that contain all sequential limits of their points.
