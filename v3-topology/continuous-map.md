description: "A map that pulls back neighborhoods of images to neighborhoods of points."

Let $X$ and $Y$ be {{< knowl id="topological-space" text="topological spaces" >}} and let $f:X\to Y$ be a {{< knowl id="function" section="shared-foundations" text="function" >}}. The map $f$ is **continuous at a point** $x\in X$ if for every {{< knowl id="neighborhood" text="neighborhood" >}} $V$ of $f(x)$ in $Y$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ in $X$ such that $f(U)\subseteq V$.

The map $f$ is **continuous** (or a **continuous map**) if it is continuous at every point of $X$. An equivalent global characterization is given by {{< knowl id="continuity-via-open-sets" text="continuity via open sets" >}}.
