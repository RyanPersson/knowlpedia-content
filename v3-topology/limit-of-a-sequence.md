A **limit of a sequence** $(x_n)$ in a metric space $(X,d)$ is a point $x\in X$ such that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $N$ with $d(x_n,x)<\varepsilon$ for all $n\ge N$. One writes $x_n\to x$.

Equivalently, $x$ is a limit if and only if every {{< knowl id="open-ball" text="open ball" >}} around $x$ contains all but finitely many terms of the sequence. Limits in metric spaces are unique because every metric space is {{< knowl id="hausdorff-space" section="topology-separation" text="Hausdorff" >}}.
