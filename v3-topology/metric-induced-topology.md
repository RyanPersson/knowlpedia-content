A **metric-induced topology** on a metric space $(X,d)$ is the {{< knowl id="topology" section="topology-core" text="topology" >}} $\tau_d$ on $X$ defined by declaring a subset $U\subseteq X$ to be open if for every $x\in U$ there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x,r)\subseteq U$, where $B(x,r)$ is the {{< knowl id="open-ball" text="open ball" >}} of radius $r$ around $x$.

With this topology, $(X,\tau_d)$ becomes a {{< knowl id="topological-space" section="topology-core" text="topological space" >}}, and the open balls form a {{< knowl id="basis-of-a-topology" section="topology-core" text="basis" >}} for $\tau_d$.
