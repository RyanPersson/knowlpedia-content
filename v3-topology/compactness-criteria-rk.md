A subset $K$ is {{< knowl id="compact-set" text="compact" >}} if it satisfies any of the following standard criteria (in the indicated settings):

- **Open cover criterion (all topological spaces):** Every {{< knowl id="open-cover" text="open cover" >}} of $K$ has a finite subcover (see {{< knowl id="finite-subcover-lemma" text="finite subcover lemma" >}}).
- **Finite intersection property (all topological spaces):** Every family of {{< knowl id="closed-set" section="topology-core" text="closed" >}} subsets of $K$ with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection (see {{< knowl id="finite-intersection-property-theorem" text="finite intersection property theorem" >}}).
- **Sequential criterion (metric spaces):** $K$ is {{< knowl id="sequentially-compact-set" text="sequentially compact" >}} (equivalently compact by {{< knowl id="sequential-compactness-equals-compactness" text="sequential compactness equals compactness" >}}).
- **Complete + totally bounded (metric spaces):** $K$ is complete and {{< knowl id="totally-bounded-set" text="totally bounded" >}} (equivalently compact by {{< knowl id="compact-iff-complete-totally-bounded" text="compact iff complete and totally bounded" >}}).
- **Closed and bounded (Euclidean spaces):** In $\mathbb R^n$, $K$ is {{< knowl id="closed-set" section="topology-core" text="closed" >}} and {{< knowl id="bounded-set" section="topology-metric" text="bounded" >}} (equivalently compact by the {{< knowl id="heine-borel-theorem" text="Heine--Borel theorem" >}}).

These criteria are routinely combined with permanence properties such as {{< knowl id="closed-subset-of-compact-set-is-compact" text="closed subsets of compact sets are compact" >}} and {{< knowl id="continuous-image-of-compact-set-is-compact" text="continuous images preserve compactness" >}}.
