title: "Connected set"
description: "A subset of a topological space that cannot be split into two disjoint nonempty open parts."

A **connected set** is a subset $C$ of a {{< knowl id="topological-space" section="topology-core" text="topological space" >}} $X$ such that there do not exist disjoint nonempty sets $U,V\subseteq C$ that are open in the {{< knowl id="subspace-topology" section="topology-core" text="subspace topology" >}} on $C$ with $C=U\cup V$.

Equivalently, the only subsets of $C$ that are both open and {{< knowl id="closed-set" section="topology-core" text="closed" >}} in $C$ are $\varnothing$ and $C$. Connectedness is preserved under {{< knowl id="continuous-map" section="topology-core" text="continuous maps" >}} and is weaker than {{< knowl id="path-connected-set" text="path connectedness" >}}.

**Examples:**
- Any interval in the real line $\mathbb{R}$ with its {{< knowl id="metric-induced-topology" section="topology-metric" text="usual topology" >}} is connected.
- The subset $[0,1]\cup[2,3]\subset\mathbb{R}$ is not connected.
