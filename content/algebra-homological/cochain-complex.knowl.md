Let \(R\) be a ring and let \(\{C^n\}_{n\in\mathbb Z}\) be [[algebra-modules/module|R-modules]].
A **cochain complex** \( (C^\bullet, d)\) is a collection of \(R\)-linear maps
\[
d^n : C^n \longrightarrow C^{n+1}\qquad (n\in\mathbb Z)
\]
such that
\[
d^{n+1}\circ d^n = 0\quad\text{for all }n.
\]
Its **cohomology modules** are
\[
H^n(C^\bullet)=\ker(d^n)/\operatorname{im}(d^{n-1}),
\]
see [[algebra-homological/cohomology-module|cohomology module]].

## Remarks
- Chain vs. cochain conventions: compare [[algebra-homological/chain-complex|chain complex]].
- Cochain complexes from \(\mathrm{Hom}\): [[algebra-modules/hom-module|Hom]] and [[algebra-homological/hom-left-exact|left exactness of Hom]].
- Cohomology as a derived functor: [[algebra-homological/derived-functor|derived functor]] and [[algebra-homological/ext|Ext]].

## Examples
1. **Cochain complex concentrated in degree 0.**
   For an \(R\)-module \(M\), the diagram
   \[
   \cdots \to 0 \to M \to 0 \to \cdots
   \]
   with \(M\) in degree \(0\) is a cochain complex. Then \(H^0\cong M\) and \(H^n=0\) for \(n\neq 0\).

2. **Hom of a chain complex is a cochain complex.**
   If \((C_\bullet,d)\) is a [[algebra-homological/chain-complex|chain complex]] and \(M\) is an \(R\)-module, define
   \[
   \operatorname{Hom}_R(C_\bullet,M)^n := \operatorname{Hom}_R(C_n,M),
   \]
   and set
   \[
   \delta^n(\varphi) := \varphi\circ d_{n+1} \in \operatorname{Hom}_R(C_{n+1},M).
   \]
   Then \(\delta^{n+1}\circ \delta^n=0\) because \(d\circ d=0\), so this is a cochain complex. This construction underlies the computation of [[algebra-homological/ext|Ext]] from a [[algebra-homological/projective-resolution|projective resolution]].

3. **“Multiplication by \(x\)” as a cochain complex.**
   For \(x\in R\), the 2-term cochain complex
   \[
   0 \to R \xrightarrow{\,\cdot x\,} R \to 0
   \]
   (degrees \(0\to 1\)) has
   \[
   H^0 \cong \operatorname{Ann}_R(x),\qquad H^1 \cong R/xR.
   \]
