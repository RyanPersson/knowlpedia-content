A [[algebra-homological/chain-complex|chain complex]] \((C_\bullet,d)\) is **exact** if any (hence all) of the following equivalent conditions hold:

1. \(H_n(C_\bullet)=0\) for all \(n\), where [[algebra-homological/homology-module|homology module]] is used.
2. For every \(n\),
   \[
   \operatorname{im}(d_{n+1}) = \ker(d_n).
   \]
3. The sequence
   \[
   \cdots \xrightarrow{d_{n+2}} C_{n+1} \xrightarrow{d_{n+1}} C_n \xrightarrow{d_n} C_{n-1}\xrightarrow{d_{n-1}} \cdots
   \]
   is exact at each \(C_n\) in the sense of kernels/images; compare [[algebra-modules/exactness-via-kernels-images|exactness via kernels and images]].

In an [[algebra-category-theory/abelian-category|abelian category]], the same definition makes sense using categorical kernels and images.

## Remarks
- Exactness for short sequences: [[algebra-modules/short-exact-sequence|short exact sequence]].
- A strong way to prove exactness is via a contracting homotopy: [[algebra-homological/chain-homotopy|chain homotopy]].
- Exact complexes appear as resolutions: [[algebra-homological/projective-resolution|projective resolution]] and [[algebra-homological/injective-resolution|injective resolution]].

## Examples
1. **A short exact sequence as an exact complex.**  
   Any short exact sequence \(0\to A\to B\to C\to 0\) of \(R\)-modules is an exact complex with \(A,B,C\) placed in degrees \(1,0,-1\) (or \(2,1,0\), depending on convention). See [[algebra-modules/exact-sequence-modules|exact sequence of modules]].

2. **Identity map complex.**  
   The 2-term complex
   \[
   0 \to R \xrightarrow{\,\mathrm{id}\,} R \to 0
   \]
   is exact: \(\ker(\mathrm{id})=0\) and \(\operatorname{coker}(\mathrm{id})=0\). In fact, it is contractible (see [[algebra-homological/chain-homotopy|chain homotopy]] example), so its homology vanishes.

3. **A standard exact sequence over \(\mathbb Z\).**  
   For \(n\ge 1\), the sequence
   \[
   0 \longrightarrow \mathbb Z \xrightarrow{\,\cdot n\,} \mathbb Z \longrightarrow \mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z \longrightarrow 0
   \]
   is short exact, hence an exact complex. This 2-term free resolution of \(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z\) is the starting point for concrete computations of [[algebra-homological/tor|Tor]] and [[algebra-homological/ext|Ext]].
