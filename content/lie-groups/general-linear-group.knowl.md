Let \(V\) be a real or complex vector space of finite dimension \(n\ge 1\).

**Definition (General linear group).**
The **general linear group** of \(V\) is
\[
\mathrm{GL}(V)=\{A:V\to V \text{ linear and invertible}\},
\]
with group operation given by composition. After choosing a basis, \(\mathrm{GL}(V)\cong \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb F)\) where \(\mathbb F=\mathbb R\) or \(\mathbb C\) and
\[
\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb F)=\{A\in M_n(\mathbb F):\det(A)\ne 0\}.
\]

## Remarks

**Lie group structure.**
Viewed as a subset of the affine space \(M_n(\mathbb F)\), \(\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb F)\) is open (since \(\det\) is continuous and \(\mathbb F^\times\) is open), hence it is a smooth manifold and a [[fiber-bundles/lie-group|Lie group]]. Its Lie algebra is the [[lie-groups/general-linear-lie-algebra|general linear Lie algebra]] \(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb F)\), identified with \(T_I\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb F)\) (compare [[lie-groups/lie-algebra-of-a-lie-group|Lie algebra of a Lie group]]).

**Basic structure.**
Over \(\mathbb C\), \(\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb C)\) is connected. Over \(\mathbb R\), \(\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb R)\) has two connected components distinguished by the sign of \(\det\). The [[lie-groups/exponential-map-lie-group|exponential map]] is the matrix exponential \(\exp:\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb F)\to \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb F)\).

**Context.**
Many linear representations of Lie groups are concretely [[lie-groups/lie-group-homomorphism|homomorphisms]] into some \(\mathrm{GL}(V)\); special subgroups such as [[lie-groups/special-linear-group|SL_n]], [[lie-groups/orthogonal-group|O(n)]], and [[lie-groups/unitary-group|U(n)]] are defined by additional algebraic constraints.
