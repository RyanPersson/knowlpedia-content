Let \(\mathfrak g\) be a [[lie-groups/lie-algebra|Lie algebra]].

**Definition (Ideal).**
A linear subspace \(\mathfrak i\subseteq \mathfrak g\) is an **ideal** if it is a [[lie-groups/lie-subalgebra|Lie subalgebra]] and
\[
[\mathfrak g,\mathfrak i]\subseteq \mathfrak i.
\]
Equivalently, \(\mathfrak i\) is stable under the [[lie-groups/adjoint-representation-of-a-lie-algebra|adjoint action]]: for every \(x\in\mathfrak g\), the endomorphism \(\mathrm{ad}_x\) maps \(\mathfrak i\) into itself.

## Remarks

**Basic consequences.**

- If \(\phi:\mathfrak g\to\mathfrak h\) is a [[lie-groups/lie-algebra-homomorphism|Lie algebra homomorphism]], then \(\ker\phi\) is an ideal.
- If \(\mathfrak i\) is an ideal, the quotient vector space \(\mathfrak g/\mathfrak i\) carries a natural [[lie-groups/quotient-lie-algebra|quotient Lie algebra]] structure.

**Examples.**
The [[lie-groups/center-of-a-lie-algebra|center]] \(Z(\mathfrak g)\) is an ideal, and the [[lie-groups/derived-subalgebra|derived subalgebra]] \([\mathfrak g,\mathfrak g]\) is an ideal (see [[lie-groups/derived-subalgebra-is-ideal-lemma|the ideal lemma]]).

**Context.**
Ideals play the role of normal subgroups in Lie theory and are central in structure results such as the [[lie-groups/levi-decomposition-theorem|Levi decomposition]].
