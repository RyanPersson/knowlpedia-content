Let \(G\) be a [[fiber-bundles/lie-group|Lie group]] and let \(\pi:G\to \mathrm{GL}(V)\) be a (finite-dimensional) [[lie-groups/representation-of-a-lie-group|representation]].

**Definition (Irreducible).**
The representation \((\pi,V)\) is **irreducible** if the only \(G\)-invariant subspaces of \(V\) are \(\{0\}\) and \(V\), i.e. there is no proper nonzero subspace \(W\subset V\) with \(\pi(g)W\subseteq W\) for all \(g\in G\).

## Remarks

**Link with the Lie algebra (connected case).**
Assume \(G\) is connected and let \(d\pi:\mathfrak g\to \mathfrak{gl}(V)\) be the differential representation (compare [[lie-groups/differential-is-lie-algebra-homomorphism|differentiation is a Lie algebra homomorphism]]). Then a subspace \(W\subset V\) is \(G\)-invariant if and only if it is invariant under \(d\pi(\mathfrak g)\). Consequently, for connected \(G\), irreducibility of \(\pi\) is equivalent to irreducibility of the induced [[lie-groups/irreducible-representation-lie-algebra|Lie algebra representation]] \((d\pi,V)\).

**Context.**
For compact connected groups, [[lie-groups/irreducible-unitary-representation|irreducible unitary representations]] are classified by highest weights (see [[lie-groups/highest-weight-theorem|highest-weight theorem]] and [[lie-groups/peter-weyl-theorem|Peter–Weyl]]).
