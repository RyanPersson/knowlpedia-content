Let \(\Phi\) be a root system in a real inner product space \(V\) (see [[lie-groups/root-system|root system]]). A **positive system** (or set of **positive roots**) is a subset \(\Phi^+ \subset \Phi\) such that:

1. \(\Phi\) is the disjoint union \(\Phi = \Phi^+ \sqcup (-\Phi^+)\), and
2. if \(\alpha,\beta \in \Phi^+\) and \(\alpha+\beta \in \Phi\), then \(\alpha+\beta \in \Phi^+\).

In the Lie algebra setting, for a semisimple Lie algebra with a [[lie-groups/cartan-subalgebra|Cartan subalgebra]], the roots (see [[lie-groups/root-lie-algebra|roots of a Lie algebra]]) can be split into positive and negative ones, producing a triangular decomposition (see [[lie-groups/root-space-decomposition|root space decomposition]]). This choice is essential for defining [[lie-groups/simple-root|simple roots]], constructing highest-weight theory, and stating results such as the [[lie-groups/highest-weight-theorem|highest weight theorem]].

## Equivalent characterizations
Equivalently, choose a linear functional \(\lambda \in V^*\) such that \(\lambda(\alpha)\neq 0\) for all \(\alpha\in\Phi\), and set
\[
\Phi^+ \;=\; \{\alpha\in\Phi : \lambda(\alpha)>0\}.
\]
Geometrically, this corresponds to choosing a Weyl chamber for the hyperplane arrangement \(\{\alpha^\perp\}_{\alpha\in\Phi}\); changing the choice is controlled by the [[lie-groups/weyl-group|Weyl group]] action.
