Let \(G\) be a [[fiber-bundles/lie-group|Lie group]] with Lie algebra \(\mathfrak g=T_eG\).

**Definition (Left Maurer–Cartan form).**
The **left Maurer–Cartan form** is the \(\mathfrak g\)-valued \(1\)-form \(\theta^L\in \Omega^1(G;\mathfrak g)\) defined by
\[
\theta^L_g : T_gG \to \mathfrak g,\qquad \theta^L_g(v)=(dL_{g^{-1}})_g(v).
\]
Equivalently, \(\theta^L\) is characterized by:

- (Normalization) \(\theta^L_e=\mathrm{id}_{\mathfrak g}\), and
- (Left invariance) \((L_h)^*\theta^L=\theta^L\) for all \(h\in G\).

## Remarks

**Maurer–Cartan equation.**
\(\theta^L\) satisfies the [[lie-groups/maurer-cartan-equation|Maurer–Cartan equation]]
\[
d\theta^L + \tfrac12[\theta^L,\theta^L]=0,
\]
where the bracket combines the Lie bracket on \(\mathfrak g\) with wedge product.

**Context and use.**
The left Maurer–Cartan form identifies tangent vectors on \(G\) with elements of \(\mathfrak g\) in a left-translation invariant way, and it packages all [[lie-groups/left-invariant-differential-form|left-invariant forms]] as alternating tensors on \(\mathfrak g\). The right-handed analogue is the [[lie-groups/right-maurer-cartan-form|right Maurer–Cartan form]].
