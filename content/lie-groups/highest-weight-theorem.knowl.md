Fix a complex semisimple [[lie-groups/lie-algebra|Lie algebra]] \(\mathfrak g\), a [[lie-groups/cartan-subalgebra|Cartan subalgebra]] \(\mathfrak h\), and a choice of [[lie-groups/positive-root|positive roots]] (hence [[lie-groups/simple-root|simple roots]] and fundamental weights).

**Theorem (Highest-weight classification, Lie algebra form).**

1. Every finite-dimensional irreducible \(\mathfrak g\)-module is a [[lie-groups/highest-weight-representation|highest-weight representation]] with a unique [[lie-groups/highest-weight|highest weight]] \(\lambda\in\mathfrak h^*\).
2. A weight \(\lambda\) occurs as the highest weight of a finite-dimensional irreducible module if and only if \(\lambda\) is **dominant integral** (i.e. it pairs with all simple coroots to give nonnegative integers).
3. For each dominant integral \(\lambda\), there exists (up to isomorphism) a unique finite-dimensional irreducible \(\mathfrak g\)-module \(V(\lambda)\) with highest weight \(\lambda\).

## Remarks

**Group form (compact groups).**
If \(G\) is a compact connected [[lie-groups/compact-lie-group|Lie group]] with maximal torus \(T\) (see [[lie-groups/maximal-torus-theorem|maximal tori]]), then [[lie-groups/irreducible-unitary-representation|irreducible unitary representations]] of \(G\) are classified by the dominant weights that lie in the character lattice \(X^*(T)\). This lattice depends on the global form of \(G\); not every dominant integral weight of the complexified Lie algebra integrates to every group with that Lie algebra.

**Context.**
This theorem is the conceptual reason that objects like [[lie-groups/fundamental-representation|fundamental representations]] (highest weights equal to fundamental weights) play a foundational role: they correspond to the vertices of the [[lie-groups/dynkin-diagram|Dynkin diagram]] and generate the dominant cone.
