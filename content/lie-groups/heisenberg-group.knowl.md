For $n\ge 1$, the (real) **Heisenberg group** $H_n$ can be realized as $\mathbb R^{2n}\times \mathbb R$ with elements written $(x,y,z)$ where $x,y\in\mathbb R^n$ and $z\in\mathbb R$, and group law
\[
(x,y,z)\cdot(x',y',z')=\Big(x+x',\,y+y',\,z+z' + \tfrac12(x\cdot y' - y\cdot x')\Big).
\]
This makes $H_n$ a connected [[fiber-bundles/lie-group|Lie group]] of dimension $2n+1$. Its Lie algebra is the Heisenberg Lie algebra (compare [[lie-groups/example-heisenberg-algebra|the Heisenberg algebra example]]), which is [[lie-groups/nilpotent-lie-algebra|nilpotent]].

## Remarks

**Concrete calculation: commutator and center.**  
Let $p=(x,y,z)$ and $q=(x',y',z')$. Using the group law and the inverse
\[
(x,y,z)^{-1}=(-x,-y,-z),
\]
one computes the commutator
\[
[p,q]=pqp^{-1}q^{-1}=(0,0,\,x\cdot y' - y\cdot x').
\]
In particular, the commutator always lies in the “$z$-axis,” which is the [[lie-groups/center-of-a-lie-group|center]]:
\[
Z(H_n)=\{(0,0,z): z\in\mathbb R\}.
\]
Thus $H_n/Z(H_n)\cong \mathbb R^{2n}$ is abelian, and $H_n$ is 2-step nilpotent (compare [[lie-groups/lower-central-series-lie-algebra|lower central series]] for the analogous Lie-algebra notion).

**Exponential/BCH viewpoint.**  
Because $H_n$ is nilpotent, the [[lie-groups/exponential-map-lie-group|exponential map]] is a global diffeomorphism and the multiplication law is governed by a truncated [[lie-groups/baker-campbell-hausdorff-formula|BCH formula]], reflecting that iterated brackets vanish after length 2.
