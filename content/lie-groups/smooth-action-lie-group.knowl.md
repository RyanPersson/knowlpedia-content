Let \(G\) be a Lie group and \(M\) a smooth manifold. A **smooth (left) action** of \(G\) on \(M\) is a smooth map
\[
a: G\times M \longrightarrow M,\qquad (g,m)\mapsto g\cdot m,
\]
such that:

1. \(e\cdot m=m\) for all \(m\in M\) (where \(e\) is the identity in \(G\)), and
2. \((g_1g_2)\cdot m=g_1\cdot(g_2\cdot m)\) for all \(g_1,g_2\in G\) and \(m\in M\).

Associated to any smooth action are the basic orbit-stabilizer constructions: the orbit \(G\cdot m\) (see [[lie-groups/orbit-lie-group|orbit]]) and the stabilizer subgroup \(G_m\) (see [[lie-groups/stabilizer-lie-group|stabilizer]]). If the action is transitive, \(M\) becomes a [[lie-groups/homogeneous-space|homogeneous space]]; if it is free, it resembles a [[lie-groups/principal-homogeneous-space|principal homogeneous space]] (compare [[lie-groups/transitive-action-lie|transitive action]] and [[lie-groups/free-action-lie|free action]]).

Differentiating at the identity produces an infinitesimal action: each \(X\in\mathfrak g=\mathrm{Lie}(G)\) defines a vector field \(X_M\) on \(M\) by
\[
(X_M)_m = \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}\exp(tX)\cdot m,
\]
linking smooth actions to [[lie-groups/one-parameter-subgroup|one-parameter subgroups]] and the [[lie-groups/exponential-map-lie-group|exponential map]]. The kernel of the action homomorphism \(G\to \mathrm{Diff}(M)\) measures whether the action is [[lie-groups/effective-action|effective]].
