Let \(\mathcal C\) be a [[algebra-category-theory/category|category]] and let \(A,B\) be [[algebra-category-theory/object|objects]] of \(\mathcal C\).

A **(binary) categorical product** of \(A\) and \(B\) is a triple \((A\times B,\pi_1,\pi_2)\) consisting of an object \(A\times B\) and morphisms
\[
\pi_1:A\times B\to A,\qquad \pi_2:A\times B\to B
\]
such that for every object \(X\) and every pair of morphisms \(f:X\to A\), \(g:X\to B\), there exists a **unique** morphism
\[
\langle f,g\rangle : X\to A\times B
\]
making the equations
\[
\pi_1\circ \langle f,g\rangle = f,\qquad \pi_2\circ \langle f,g\rangle = g
\]
hold (see [[algebra-category-theory/composition-category|composition]]).

In diagram form:

```tikz-cd
& X \arrow[dl, "f"'] \arrow[d, "{\langle f,g\rangle}" description] \arrow[dr, "g"] & \\
A & A\times B \arrow[l, "\pi_1"] \arrow[r, "\pi_2"'] & B
```

## Properties

A product is unique up to unique [[algebra-category-theory/isomorphism-category|isomorphism]]: if \((P,\pi_1,\pi_2)\) and \((P',\pi_1',\pi_2')\) are both products of \(A,B\), there is a unique isomorphism \(P\cong P'\) compatible with projections.

This is a special case of a [[algebra-category-theory/limit|limit]] (the limit of the discrete diagram \(A\;\;B\)).

## Examples

1. **\(\mathbf{Set}\)**.
   The categorical product is the usual [[shared-foundations/cartesian-product|cartesian product]] \(A\times B\) of sets, with projections \(\pi_1(a,b)=a\), \(\pi_2(a,b)=b\).

2. **\(\mathbf{Grp}\)**.
   For groups \(G,H\), the product is the direct product \(G\times H\) with coordinate projections, characterized by: giving a homomorphism \(X\to G\times H\) is equivalent to giving a pair of homomorphisms \(X\to G\) and \(X\to H\).

3. **\(\mathbf{Top}\)** (and similarly \(\mathbf{Ab}\), \(R\)-Mod).
   The product of spaces \(X,Y\) is the set-theoretic product \(X\times Y\) equipped with the product topology; the projections are continuous and satisfy the same universal property.
