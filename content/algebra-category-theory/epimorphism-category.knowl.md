Let \(\mathcal C\) be a [[algebra-category-theory/category|category]] and let \(f:A\to B\) be a [[algebra-category-theory/morphism|morphism]] in \(\mathcal C\).

The morphism \(f\) is an **epimorphism** (or **epi**) if it is *right-cancellative* with respect to [[algebra-category-theory/composition-category|composition]]: for every object \(C\) of \(\mathcal C\) and all morphisms \(g,h:B\to C\),
\[
g\circ f = h\circ f \quad \Longrightarrow \quad g=h.
\]

## Equivalent characterizations

Equivalently, postcomposition with \(f\) induces an injective map of hom-sets
\[
\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal C}(B,C)\;\longrightarrow\;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal C}(A,C),\qquad g\mapsto g\circ f,
\]
for every object \(C\).

## Properties
- Every [[algebra-category-theory/isomorphism-category|isomorphism]] is an epimorphism.
- Epimorphisms are stable under composition: if \(f:A\to B\) and \(g:B\to C\) are epis, then \(g\circ f\) is an epi.
- **Duality:** \(f\) is an epi in \(\mathcal C\) iff \(f\) is a [[algebra-category-theory/monomorphism-category|monomorphism]] in the [[algebra-category-theory/opposite-category|opposite category]] \(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}}\).

## Examples
1. **\(\mathbf{Set}\):** A function \(f:A\to B\) is an epimorphism in \(\mathbf{Set}\) iff it is a [[shared-foundations/surjective-function|surjective function]].

2. **\(\mathbf{Grp}\), \(\mathbf{Ab}\), \(R\mathbf{-Mod}\):** A homomorphism (or \(R\)-linear map) is an epimorphism iff it is surjective on the underlying sets.
   In particular, the quotient map \(G\to G/N\) and the canonical projection \(M\to M/N\) are epis.

3. **\(\mathbf{Top}\):** A continuous map \(f:X\to Y\) is an epimorphism in \(\mathbf{Top}\) iff it is surjective as a map of underlying sets.

## Remarks
Not every category has the property “epis are surjective on underlying sets” (for instance, in some algebraic categories epimorphisms can fail to be surjective). The definition above is the one that makes sense in an arbitrary [[algebra-category-theory/category|category]].
