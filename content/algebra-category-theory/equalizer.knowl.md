Let \(\mathcal C\) be a [[algebra-category-theory/category|category]] and let \(f,g:A\to B\) be parallel [[algebra-category-theory/morphism|morphisms]] in \(\mathcal C\).

An **equalizer** of \(f\) and \(g\) is a morphism \(e:E\to A\) such that:
1. (**Equalizing condition**) \(f\circ e = g\circ e\),
2. (**Universal property**) for any morphism \(h:X\to A\) with \(f\circ h=g\circ h\), there exists a unique morphism \(u:X\to E\) such that
   \[
   e\circ u = h.
   \]

## Equivalent characterizations

Equivalently, \(e:E\to A\) is universal among arrows into \(A\) on which \(f\) and \(g\) agree:

```tikz-cd
X \arrow[r, dashed, "u"] \arrow[dr, "h"'] & E \arrow[d, "e"] \\
& A \arrow[r, shift left=0.6ex, "f"] \arrow[r, shift right=0.6ex, "g"'] & B
```

with \(f\circ e=g\circ e\) and \(f\circ h=g\circ h\).

## Remarks

An equalizer (when it exists) is a special case of a [[algebra-category-theory/limit|limit]].

## Properties
- The equalizer morphism \(e:E\to A\) is always a [[algebra-category-theory/monomorphism-category|monomorphism]]: it is “injective” in the categorical sense.
- In an [[algebra-category-theory/abelian-category|abelian category]], the equalizer of \(f,g\) can be identified with a [[algebra-category-theory/kernel-categorical|kernel]]:
  \[
  \mathrm{Eq}(f,g)\;\cong\;\ker(f-g).
  \]

## Examples
1. **\(\mathbf{Set}\)**.
   If \(f,g:A\to B\) are functions, the equalizer is the subset
   \[
   E=\{a\in A \mid f(a)=g(a)\}\subseteq A,
   \]
   with \(e:E\hookrightarrow A\) the inclusion.

2. **\(\mathbf{Grp}\)**.
   For homomorphisms \(f,g:G\to H\), the equalizer is the subgroup
   \[
   E=\{x\in G \mid f(x)=g(x)\}\le G,
   \]
   included into \(G\).

3. **\(\mathbf{Ab}\) (or \(R\)-Mod)**.
   For module homomorphisms \(f,g:M\to N\), the equalizer is the submodule
   \[
   E=\ker(f-g)\subseteq M,
   \]
   with the inclusion \(E\hookrightarrow M\).
