Let \(M\) be a connected [[fiber-bundles/smooth-manifold|smooth manifold]] and let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]] with structure group a [[fiber-bundles/lie-group|Lie group]] \(G\). Fix a [[fiber-bundles/principal-connection|principal connection]] \(\omega\) on \(P\). Let \(H\subseteq G\) be a closed Lie subgroup.

## Principle (holonomy containment implies reduction)

Suppose there exists a point \(p\in P\) such that the [[fiber-bundles/holonomy-group|holonomy group]] satisfies
\[
\mathrm{Hol}_p(\omega)\subseteq H.
\]
Then there exists a principal \(H\)-subbundle \(Q\subseteq P\) (an \(H\)-reduction of structure group) with the following properties:

1. \(Q\) is preserved by the horizontal distribution of \(\omega\) (equivalently, any \(\omega\)-horizontal curve starting in \(Q\) remains in \(Q\)), and  
2. the restriction of \(\omega\) to \(Q\) is a principal connection on \(Q\) with values in the Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{h}\).

Conversely, if \(Q\subseteq P\) is a principal \(H\)-subbundle such that the restriction \(\omega|_Q\) is an \(H\)-connection on \(Q\), then for every \(q\in Q\) one has \(\mathrm{Hol}_q(\omega)\subseteq H\).

Equivalently (and often more practical): there exists such an \(H\)-reduction preserved by \(\omega\) if and only if the associated bundle \(P\times_G (G/H)\to M\) admits a [[fiber-bundles/section-of-a-fiber-bundle|global section]] that is parallel with respect to the induced connection (i.e., constant under [[fiber-bundles/parallel-transport|parallel transport]]).

## Examples

1. **Riemannian holonomy yields an orthonormal frame reduction.**  
   For a [[differential-geometry/riemannian-manifold|Riemannian manifold]], the Levi-Civita connection has holonomy contained in \(\mathrm{O}(n)\), so the \(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})\) frame bundle reduces to the orthonormal frame bundle in a way preserved by the connection.

2. **Kähler holonomy reduces to a unitary group.**  
   For a [[differential-geometry/kahler-manifold|Kähler manifold]], the Levi-Civita holonomy is contained in \(\mathrm{U}(n)\), so the real frame bundle reduces to a \(\mathrm{U}(n)\)-subbundle compatible with the complex structure and metric.

3. **Holonomy contained in the identity gives a global parallel frame on simply connected bases.**  
   If \(\mathrm{Hol}_p(\omega)=\{e\}\) and \(M\) is simply connected, then parallel transport is path-independent and produces a global trivialization by parallel frames; in particular one gets a reduction to the trivial subgroup.
