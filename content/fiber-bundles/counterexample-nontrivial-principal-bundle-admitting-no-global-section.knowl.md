Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]].

## Triviality criterion via sections
A smooth [[fiber-bundles/section-of-a-fiber-bundle|global section]] \(s:M\to P\) (so \(\pi\circ s=\mathrm{id}_M\)) trivializes \(P\):

- Define
  \[
  \Phi:M\times G\to P,\qquad \Phi(x,g):=s(x)\cdot g.
  \]
- Then \(\Phi\) is a \(G\)-equivariant diffeomorphism covering \(\mathrm{id}_M\).
- Hence \(P\) is isomorphic to the [[fiber-bundles/trivial-principal-bundle-mgm|trivial principal bundle]] \(M\times G\).

Conversely, the trivial bundle \(M\times G\to M\) always has the canonical section \(x\mapsto(x,e)\).

So:
\[
P \text{ is trivial } \Longleftrightarrow P \text{ admits a global smooth section.}
\]

## Counterexample (no global section)
The Hopf bundle \(\pi:S^3\to S^2\) is a principal \(U(1)\)-bundle that admits **no** global smooth section, and therefore is nontrivial. Concretely, a section would give a \(U(1)\)-equivariant identification \(S^3\cong S^2\times U(1)\), contradicting the known topology of \(S^3\) and the nontrivial clutching of the bundle.

## Examples
1. **Hopf fibration.**  
   The [[fiber-bundles/hopf-fibration-s3s2-as-a-principal-u-bundle|Hopf fibration]] has no global section, so it is not isomorphic to \(S^2\times U(1)\).

2. **Circle base with disconnected structure group.**  
   Using the [[fiber-bundles/principal-bundle-over-s1-defined-by-a-clutching-function|clutching construction over the circle]] with \(G=\mathrm{O}(1)=\{\pm1\}\) and gluing element \(-1\) produces a nontrivial principal bundle over \(S^1\); it has no global section.

3. **Trivial bundles always have sections.**  
   For any \(M\) and \(G\), the section \(x\mapsto(x,e)\) exhibits \(M\times G\to M\) as trivial.
