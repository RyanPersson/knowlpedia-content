Let $\pi:P\to M$ be a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]], written using the standard convention that $P$ carries a right $G$-action (see [[fiber-bundles/convention-principal-bundles-use-a-right-g-action-on-p|the principal bundle action convention]]). Let $F$ be a smooth manifold with a left $G$-action, as in [[fiber-bundles/convention-associated-bundles-use-a-left-g-action-on-the-fiber-f|the associated bundle fiber action convention]].

Form the [[fiber-bundles/associated-bundle|associated bundle]]
$$
E := P\times_G F \;\longrightarrow\; M,
$$
as in [[fiber-bundles/construction-associated-bundle-p-g-f-from-a-left-g-space-f|the construction of associated bundles]].

### Construction: section gives an equivariant map
Let $s:M\to E$ be a smooth section. Define a map $\Phi_s:P\to F$ by the rule:
- given $p\in P$ with $\pi(p)=x$, write the point $s(x)\in E_x$ as an equivalence class $[p,f]$, and set $\Phi_s(p):=f$.

This is well-defined and smooth, and it satisfies the equivariance condition
$$
\Phi_s(p\cdot g) = g^{-1}\cdot \Phi_s(p)
\qquad\text{for all }p\in P,\ g\in G,
$$
i.e. $\Phi_s$ is an [[fiber-bundles/equivariant-map|equivariant map]] with respect to the right action on $P$ and the given left action on $F$.

### Converse: equivariant map gives a section
Conversely, if $\Phi:P\to F$ is smooth and satisfies $\Phi(p\cdot g)=g^{-1}\cdot \Phi(p)$, then
$$
s_\Phi(x) := [p,\Phi(p)]\in E_x
$$
is independent of the choice of $p\in P_x$ and defines a smooth section $s_\Phi:M\to E$.

Together, these constructions give a natural bijection
$$
\Gamma(E)\ \cong\ \{\,\Phi:P\to F\text{ smooth} \mid \Phi(p\cdot g)=g^{-1}\cdot \Phi(p)\,\}.
$$

## Examples
1. **Trivial principal bundle reduces equivariance to an ordinary map.**
   If $P=M\times G$ is [[fiber-bundles/trivial-principal-bundle-mgm|trivial]], then any section of $E=(M\times G)\times_G F \cong M\times F$ is the same as a smooth map $u:M\to F$. The corresponding equivariant map is
   $$
   \Phi_u(x,g) = g^{-1}\cdot u(x).
   $$

2. **Associated line bundle and equivariant complex-valued functions.**
   Take $G=U(1)$ acting on $F=\mathbb C$ by scalar multiplication, and let $E=P\times_{U(1)}\mathbb C$ be the associated complex line bundle (see [[fiber-bundles/associated-vector-bundle|associated vector bundles]] for the general vector-bundle case). A section of $E$ corresponds to a smooth function $\Phi:P\to\mathbb C$ satisfying
   $$
   \Phi(p\cdot e^{i\theta}) = e^{-i\theta}\,\Phi(p).
   $$
   This is the standard “equivariant function” description of sections of a line bundle.

3. **Adjoint bundle: sections as conjugation-equivariant maps.**
   Let $F=G$ with the conjugation action, so $E=P\times_G G$ is the [[fiber-bundles/adjoint-bundle-p-g-g-with-conjugation-action|adjoint bundle]]. A section then corresponds to a map $\Phi:P\to G$ satisfying
   $$
   \Phi(p\cdot g)=g^{-1}\Phi(p)g.
   $$
   Interpreting such sections as bundle automorphisms recovers the usual identification of the [[fiber-bundles/gauge-group|gauge group]] with sections of the adjoint bundle (compare [[fiber-bundles/gauge-transformation|gauge transformations]]).
