Let \(E\to M\) be a smooth real rank-\(n\) vector bundle over a [[fiber-bundles/smooth-manifold|smooth manifold]] \(M\). Denote by \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\to M\) the principal \(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\)-bundle of frames of \(E\) (ordered bases of each fiber).

The following data are naturally equivalent:

1. A vector bundle connection \(\nabla\) on \(E\) (a covariant derivative satisfying the Leibniz rule).

2. A [[fiber-bundles/principal-connection|principal connection]] on the principal bundle \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\to M\).

3. A \(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\)-equivariant horizontal distribution \(H\subset T\,\mathrm{Fr}(E)\), i.e. a smooth subbundle such that
   \[
   T_p\mathrm{Fr}(E)=H_p\oplus \ker(d\pi_p)\quad\text{and}\quad (dR_A)(H_p)=H_{p\cdot A}
   \]
   for all \(A\in \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\), where \(R_A\) is the right action on frames.

4. A connection 1-form \(\omega\in\Omega^1(\mathrm{Fr}(E);\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb R))\) satisfying the standard axioms (reproduces fundamental vertical fields and is equivariant under the right action).

Moreover, under this correspondence:

- Given a principal connection on \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\), one obtains \(\nabla\) by declaring that a section of \(E\) is parallel if and only if its equivariant function on \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\) is constant along horizontal lifts (equivalently, parallel transport in \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\) induces parallel transport in \(E\)).

- Given \(\nabla\), one obtains a principal connection on \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\) by transporting frames along curves using the induced [[fiber-bundles/parallel-transport|parallel transport]] and taking the resulting horizontal lifts of tangent vectors.

A useful special case is \(E=TM\): connections on the tangent bundle correspond to principal connections on the [[fiber-bundles/frame-bundle-fr-of-a-manifold-m|frame bundle]] of \(M\).

## Examples
1. **Trivial bundle and matrix-valued 1-forms.**
   For the [[fiber-bundles/trivial-vector-bundle-mvm|trivial vector bundle]] \(E=M\times\mathbb R^n\), a connection is determined by a matrix of 1-forms \(A\in\Omega^1(M;\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb R))\) via
   \[
   \nabla = d + A
   \]
   in the standard frame. The corresponding principal connection on \(M\times \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\) has connection form obtained from \(A\) in that trivialization.

2. **Riemannian geometry.**
   On a Riemannian manifold, the Levi–Civita connection on \(TM\) corresponds to a principal connection on the [[fiber-bundles/orthonormal-frame-bundle-o-of-a-riemannian-manifold|orthonormal frame bundle]] (a reduction from \(\mathrm{GL}(n)\) to \(\mathrm{O}(n)\)).

3. **Line bundles.**
   For a real line bundle \(L\to M\), the frame bundle is a principal \(\mathrm{GL}(1,\mathbb R)\cong \mathbb R^\times\)-bundle. A connection on \(L\) is equivalent to a principal connection on that frame bundle; in a local trivialization, it is described by an ordinary 1-form.
