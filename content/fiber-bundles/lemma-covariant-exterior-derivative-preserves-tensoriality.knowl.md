Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]] with right action \(R_g:P\to P\), and let \(\rho:G\to \mathrm{GL}(V)\) be a finite-dimensional representation with differential \(\rho_*:\mathfrak g\to \mathfrak{gl}(V)\) (see [[lie-groups/representation-of-a-lie-group|representation of a Lie group]]).

A \(V\)-valued \(k\)-form \(\alpha\in \Omega^k(P;V)\) is **tensorial of type \(\rho\)** if
1. (**Horizontality**) \(\alpha_p(v_1,\dots,v_k)=0\) whenever at least one \(v_i\) is vertical (i.e. tangent to the fiber), equivalently \(\iota_{X^\#}\alpha=0\) for all fundamental vertical vector fields \(X^\#\) (compare [[fiber-bundles/vertical-subbundle|vertical subbundle]] and [[fiber-bundles/convention-fundamental-vector-field-x-is-defined-using-the-right-action|fundamental vector fields]]).
2. (**\(\rho\)-equivariance**) \((R_g)^*\alpha=\rho(g^{-1})\alpha\) for all \(g\in G\) (compare [[fiber-bundles/equivariant-map|equivariance]]).

Fix a [[fiber-bundles/principal-connection|principal connection]] with connection \(1\)-form \(\omega\in \Omega^1(P;\mathfrak g)\) (see [[fiber-bundles/connection-1-form-on-a-principal-bundle|connection 1-form]]). Let \(\mathrm{hor}:TP\to TP\) denote the horizontal projection determined by \(\omega\). The **covariant exterior derivative** of a \(V\)-valued \(k\)-form is the operator
\[
D^\omega:\Omega^k(P;V)\longrightarrow \Omega^{k+1}(P;V),
\qquad
(D^\omega\alpha)(v_0,\dots,v_k):=d\alpha(\mathrm{hor}\,v_0,\dots,\mathrm{hor}\,v_k).
\]

## Equivalent characterizations

Equivalently, on tensorial forms one may write the usual local formula
\[
D^\omega\alpha = d\alpha + \rho_*(\omega)\wedge \alpha,
\]
where the wedge combines \(\mathfrak{gl}(V)\) acting on \(V\) with the exterior product.

## Lemma
If \(\alpha\) is tensorial of type \(\rho\), then \(D^\omega\alpha\) is also tensorial of type \(\rho\).

In other words, the covariant exterior derivative restricts to a well-defined map
\[
D^\omega:\Omega^k_{\mathrm{tens}}(P;V)\longrightarrow \Omega^{k+1}_{\mathrm{tens}}(P;V),
\]
where \(\Omega^k_{\mathrm{tens}}(P;V)\) denotes \(V\)-valued tensorial \(k\)-forms. This is the basic mechanism behind induced connections on [[fiber-bundles/associated-bundle|associated bundles]] and, in the vector bundle case, on [[fiber-bundles/associated-vector-bundle|associated vector bundles]].

## Examples
1. **From equivariant functions to covariant derivatives.**
   A tensorial \(0\)-form of type \(\rho\) is just a \(\rho\)-equivariant function \(f:P\to V\). Under the identification of such functions with sections of the associated bundle \(E=P\times_\rho V\) (see [[fiber-bundles/equivariant-map-pf-associated-to-a-section-of-p-g-f|equivariant maps and sections]]), the tensorial \(1\)-form \(D^\omega f\) corresponds to the covariant derivative \(\nabla s\) of the associated section \(s\in \Gamma(E)\) (see [[fiber-bundles/covariant-derivative-of-a-section|covariant derivative of a section]]).

2. **Adjoint-valued forms and the Bianchi identity setting.**
   Taking \(V=\mathfrak g\) with the adjoint representation (see [[lie-groups/adjoint-action-of-a-lie-group|adjoint action]]), tensorial \(\mathfrak g\)-valued forms are the same objects that appear in [[fiber-bundles/covariant-exterior-derivative-on-ad-valued-forms|covariant exterior derivatives on adjoint-valued forms]]. In particular, the curvature form \(F^\omega\in\Omega^2(P;\mathfrak g)\) (see [[fiber-bundles/curvature-2-form-of-a-principal-connection|curvature 2-form]]) is tensorial, hence \(D^\omega F^\omega\) is a well-defined tensorial \(3\)-form.

3. **Frame bundle viewpoint.**
   On the frame bundle of a vector bundle (see [[fiber-bundles/construction-frame-bundle-fr-of-a-vector-bundle-e|frame bundle construction]]), tensorial forms of the defining representation encode tensor fields on the base. The lemma guarantees that applying \(D^\omega\) to such a tensorial form produces another tensorial form, which is exactly what is needed for defining covariant derivatives of tensor fields via the frame bundle picture (compare [[fiber-bundles/tfae-vector-bundle-connections-via-frame-bundles-rank-n-vector-bundle-em|connections via frame bundles]]).
