Let \(E\to M\) be a smooth real rank-\(n\) vector bundle over a smooth manifold \(M\). Its frame bundle \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\to M\) is a principal \(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\)-bundle.

A **reduction of structure group** from \(\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\) to a subgroup \(H\subset \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\) is, by definition, a principal \(H\)-subbundle \(Q\subset \mathrm{Fr}(E)\) such that
\[
Q\times_H \mathbb R^n \cong E
\]
as associated bundles.

## Example (bundle metric gives an O(n)-reduction)
A **bundle metric** on \(E\) is a smooth choice of inner product \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_x\) on each fiber \(E_x\).

Given such a metric, define
\[
O(E):=\{u\in \mathrm{Fr}(E): u:\mathbb R^n\to E_x \text{ is an isometry for the standard inner product}\}.
\]
Then:
- \(O(E)\to M\) is a principal \(\mathrm{O}(n)\)-bundle, where \(\mathrm{O}(n)\) is a [[fiber-bundles/lie-group|Lie group]] acting by postcomposition on frames.
- The inclusion \(O(E)\subset \mathrm{Fr}(E)\) is a reduction of the principal [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]] \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\to M\) from \(\mathrm{GL}(n)\) to \(\mathrm{O}(n)\).
- Conversely, any principal \(\mathrm{O}(n)\)-subbundle \(Q\subset \mathrm{Fr}(E)\) determines a unique bundle metric by declaring frames in \(Q\) to be orthonormal.

Specializing to \(E=TM\) recovers the construction of the [[fiber-bundles/orthonormal-frame-bundle-o-of-a-riemannian-manifold|orthonormal frame bundle]].

## Examples
1. **Riemannian manifolds.**
   For \(E=TM\), choosing a Riemannian metric on \(M\) produces the reduction \(\mathrm{Fr}(TM)\supset O(TM)\).

2. **Trivial bundle with standard metric.**
   For the trivial bundle \(M\times\mathbb R^n\), the standard Euclidean inner product yields \(O(E)\cong M\times \mathrm{O}(n)\) as a reduction of \(M\times \mathrm{GL}(n)\).

3. **Changing the metric changes the reduction.**
   Two different bundle metrics on the same underlying bundle generally produce different \(\mathrm{O}(n)\)-subbundles of \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\), even though both reductions have the same associated bundle \(E\).
