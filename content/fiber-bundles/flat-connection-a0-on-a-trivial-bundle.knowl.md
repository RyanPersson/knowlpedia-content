Let $P=M\times G\to M$ be the [[fiber-bundles/trivial-principal-bundle-mgm|trivial principal bundle]] over a smooth manifold $M$.

## Definition (product connection / zero gauge potential)
Define a horizontal subspace at $(x,g)\in M\times G$ by
\[
H_{(x,g)} := T_xM \times \{0\} \;\subset\; T_xM\oplus T_gG \cong T_{(x,g)}(M\times G).
\]
This $G$-invariant splitting defines a [[fiber-bundles/principal-connection|principal connection]] on $P$, often called the **product connection**.

In the global trivialization given by the canonical section $s(x)=(x,e)$, the associated gauge potential is the $\mathfrak g$-valued 1-form $A\in\Omega^1(M;\mathfrak g)$ given by $A=0$.

## Properties
- The [[fiber-bundles/curvature|curvature]] of this connection vanishes identically.
- [[fiber-bundles/parallel-transport|Parallel transport]] along a curve $\gamma$ keeps the $G$-coordinate constant in the product chart.
- The [[fiber-bundles/holonomy-group|holonomy group]] is trivial (contained in the identity element), for each basepoint.

The induced connection on any associated vector bundle $M\times V$ is the “ordinary derivative” connection: in the standard frame, $\nabla=d$.

## Examples
1. **Flat connections on trivial line bundles.**  
   On $M\times U(1)$, this is the standard flat circle-bundle connection; parallel transport is literally constant phase in the chosen trivialization.

2. **Associated vector bundle: constant sections are parallel.**  
   For $E=M\times\mathbb R^n$, the induced connection satisfies $\nabla s=ds$; in particular, constant maps $s:M\to\mathbb R^n$ are parallel sections.

3. **Restriction to open subsets.**  
   If $U\subset M$ is open, restricting the trivial bundle and this connection to $U$ gives the same product connection on $U\times G\to U$.
