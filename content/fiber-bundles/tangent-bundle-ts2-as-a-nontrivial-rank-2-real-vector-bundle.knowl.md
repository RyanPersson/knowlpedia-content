Let \(S^2\) be the 2-sphere. Its [[fiber-bundles/tangent-bundle|tangent bundle]] \(\pi:TS^2\to S^2\) is a smooth real [[fiber-bundles/vector-bundle|vector bundle]] of rank \(2\).

The bundle \(TS^2\) is **not** isomorphic (as a rank-2 real vector bundle) to the [[fiber-bundles/trivial-vector-bundle-mvm|trivial rank-2 bundle]] \(S^2\times \mathbb R^2\).

A standard proof uses the “hairy ball” phenomenon: every continuous tangent vector field on \(S^2\) has a zero. Since a global [[fiber-bundles/nowhere-vanishing-section|nowhere-zero section]] would trivialize a rank-1 subbundle and (together with a second independent section) produce a global frame, this obstructs triviality.

## Equivalent characterizations
Equivalently:
- \(TS^2\) does not admit a global frame of smooth sections, and in particular
- \(TS^2\) admits no nowhere-vanishing smooth [[fiber-bundles/vector-field|vector field]] on \(S^2\).

## Examples
1. **Local triviality is easy: remove a point.**
   On \(S^2\setminus\{p\}\cong \mathbb R^2\), the tangent bundle is trivial: \(T(S^2\setminus\{p\})\cong (S^2\setminus\{p\})\times\mathbb R^2\). The obstruction is global, not local.

2. **Contrast with the circle.**
   The circle \(S^1\) admits a nowhere-vanishing tangent vector field (rotation), so \(TS^1\) is trivial. This highlights that the failure for \(S^2\) is not automatic for spheres.

3. **Frame bundle reflection.**
   Nontriviality of \(TS^2\) implies that the frame bundle \(\mathrm{Fr}(TS^2)\) is not globally a product \(S^2\times \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb R)\), even though it is locally trivial by definition.
