This is the \(1\)-dimensional case of the general [[fiber-bundles/clutching-function|clutching construction]] for bundles.

Let \(G\) be a [[fiber-bundles/lie-group|Lie group]], and consider the circle as a quotient \(S^1 \cong [0,1]/(0\sim 1)\).

## Construction (gluing by an element of G)
Fix an element \(g\in G\). Define
\[
P_g := \big([0,1]\times G\big)\big/\sim,
\]
where the equivalence relation identifies the ends by
\[
(0,h)\sim (1,gh)\qquad\text{for all }h\in G.
\]
Let \(\pi:P_g\to S^1\) be induced by the projection \([0,1]\times G\to [0,1]\to S^1\), and let \(G\) act on \(P_g\) by the right action
\[
[(t,h)]\cdot k := [(t,hk)].
\]
Then \(\pi:P_g\to S^1\) is a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]].

One can describe this equivalently in transition-function language: choose an open cover of \(S^1\) by two arcs \(U_0,U_1\) so that \(U_0\cap U_1\) has two connected components, and take transition functions that are constant on each component, with one of them equal to \(g\). This viewpoint ties the construction to [[fiber-bundles/principal-bundle-transition-function|principal bundle transition functions]] and the [[fiber-bundles/cocycle-condition-for-transition-functions|cocycle condition]].

## Isomorphism remarks
- In general, the isomorphism class of \(P_g\) depends only on the conjugacy class of the component of \(g\) in \(\pi_0(G)\), and every principal \(G\)-bundle over \(S^1\) arises from this construction.
- If \(G\) is connected, then \(\pi_0(G)\) is trivial, so every principal \(G\)-bundle over \(S^1\) is trivial. In that case, each \(P_g\) is isomorphic to the [[fiber-bundles/trivial-principal-bundle-mgm|trivial principal bundle]] even when \(g\neq e\).
- If \(G\) is discrete, then \(\pi_0(G)=G\), and the classification reduces to homomorphisms \(\pi_1(S^1)\cong \mathbb Z\to G\) up to conjugation, i.e. conjugacy classes of elements of \(G\), matching the intuition that \(g\) records a “monodromy.” For a general disconnected Lie group, it is the component of \(g\) in \(\pi_0(G)\) that carries this information.

## Examples
1. **Discrete group G = Z2: trivial vs nontrivial double cover.**
   For \(G=\mathbb Z_2=\{\pm 1\}\), the construction gives two isomorphism classes: \(P_{+1}\) (trivial) and \(P_{-1}\) (nontrivial). The nontrivial bundle corresponds to the connected double cover \(S^1\to S^1\), \(z\mapsto z^2\), viewed as a principal \(\mathbb Z_2\)-bundle.

2. **O(1) bundles and the Möbius [[fiber-bundles/line-bundle|line bundle]].**
   Since \(O(1)\cong \mathbb Z_2\), the two principal \(O(1)\)-bundles over \(S^1\) are exactly the ones above. The nontrivial principal \(O(1)\)-bundle yields, via the standard action on \(\mathbb R\), the Möbius real line bundle as an associated vector bundle (compare [[fiber-bundles/associated-vector-bundle|associated vector bundle]]).

3. **Connected groups: U(1) gives only the trivial principal bundle over S1.**
   For \(G=U(1)\) (connected), any choice of \(g\in U(1)\) produces a bundle \(P_g\) that is isomorphic to \(S^1\times U(1)\). This is a concrete instance of the equivalence “bundle is trivial iff it admits a [[fiber-bundles/section-of-a-fiber-bundle|global section]],” as in [[fiber-bundles/tfae-triviality-of-a-principal-g-bundle-principal-g-bundle-pm|the triviality criteria for principal bundles]].
