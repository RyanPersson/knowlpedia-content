Let \(U\subseteq M\) be open, let \(G\) be a Lie group with Lie algebra \(\mathfrak g\), and let
\[
A\in\Omega^1(U;\mathfrak g)
\]
be a [[fiber-bundles/local-connection-1-form|local connection 1-form]]. Its local curvature is
\[
F:=dA + A\wedge A\in\Omega^2(U;\mathfrak g),
\]
as in [[fiber-bundles/local-curvature-formula-f-da-aa|the local curvature formula]].

## Lemma (curvature transformation law)
Given a smooth map \(g:U\to G\), define the gauge-transformed local connection 1-form by
\[
A^g := g^{-1}Ag + g^{-1}dg,
\]
which is the [[fiber-bundles/lemma-local-gauge-transformation-law-ag-g-1ag-g-1dg|standard local gauge transformation]]. Let
\[
F^g:=dA^g + A^g\wedge A^g
\]
be its curvature. Then
\[
F^g = g^{-1}Fg.
\]
Equivalently, \(F\) transforms by the [[lie-groups/adjoint-action-of-a-lie-group|adjoint action]] of \(G\) on \(\mathfrak g\).

### Proof (calculation)
Expand \(F^g\) using \(A^g=g^{-1}Ag+g^{-1}dg\) and the Leibniz rule:
- the mixed terms involving \(d(g^{-1}dg)\) cancel using the Maurer--Cartan identity for \(g^{-1}dg\),
- the remaining terms regroup into \(g^{-1}(dA + A\wedge A)g\).

This is the usual statement that curvature is tensorial under gauge transformations.

A direct consequence is that on overlaps \(U_i\cap U_j\) with transition function \(g_{ij}\), the local curvature forms satisfy
\[
F_j = g_{ij}^{-1}F_i g_{ij},
\]
so invariant polynomials applied to \(F_i\) glue to globally defined [[fiber-bundles/chernweil-form|Chern--Weil forms]].

## Examples
1. **Abelian groups (electromagnetism).**
   If \(G\) is abelian (for example \(U(1)\)), then \(g^{-1}Fg=F\), so the curvature 2-form is gauge invariant. In particular, the transformation reduces to \(A^g=A+g^{-1}dg\) while \(F^g=dA^g=dA=F\).

2. **Pure gauge connections have zero curvature.**
   On a trivial bundle, if \(A=g^{-1}dg\) is [[fiber-bundles/pure-gauge-connection-ag-1dg-on-a-trivial-bundle|pure gauge]], then \(F=dA+A\wedge A=0\). The lemma then gives \(F^h=h^{-1}0\,h=0\) for any further gauge transformation \(h\).

3. **Associated vector bundles (matrix conjugation).**
   If \(G\) acts on a vector space via a representation (see [[lie-groups/representation-of-a-lie-group|representation]]), the induced curvature on the associated vector bundle is a matrix-valued 2-form, and this lemma becomes the familiar rule “curvature matrices conjugate under change of frame.”
