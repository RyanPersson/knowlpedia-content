Associated bundles combine the [[fiber-bundles/right-principal-action|right principal action]] on a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal bundle]] with a left action on the model fiber.

## Convention
Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a principal \(G\)-bundle equipped with the right action \(P\times G\to P\), \((p,g)\mapsto p\cdot g\) (see [[fiber-bundles/convention-principal-bundles-use-a-right-g-action-on-p|right action convention]]). Let \(F\) be a smooth left \(G\)-space, i.e. a manifold with a smooth action \(G\times F\to F\), \((g,f)\mapsto g\cdot f\) (compare [[fiber-bundles/smooth-action-of-a-lie-group-on-a-manifold|smooth group action]]).

We define the **associated bundle**
\[
P\times_G F
\]
to be the quotient of \(P\times F\) by the equivalence relation
\[
(p\cdot g,\ f)\sim (p,\ g\cdot f).
\]
We denote the equivalence class of \((p,f)\) by \([p,f]\). The projection
\[
[p,f]\longmapsto \pi(p)
\]
is well-defined and makes \(P\times_G F\to M\) into a [[fiber-bundles/associated-bundle|fiber bundle associated to P]]. This is the convention used in [[fiber-bundles/construction-associated-bundle-p-g-f-from-a-left-g-space-f|the associated bundle construction]].

A useful bookkeeping consequence is the following: if local sections \(s_i:U_i\to P\) define transition functions by \(s_j=s_i\,g_{ij}\) (as in [[fiber-bundles/construction-transition-functions-g-iju-iu-jg-from-local-sections|transition functions from local sections]]), then the induced local trivializations satisfy
\[
[s_j(x),f]=[s_i(x),\,g_{ij}(x)\cdot f],
\]
so the same \(g_{ij}\) acts on the fiber by the given left action.

## Examples
1. **Associated vector bundle from a representation.**
   If \(\rho:G\to GL(V)\) is a [[lie-groups/representation-of-a-lie-group|representation]], then \(V\) is a left \(G\)-space via \(g\cdot v:=\rho(g)v\), and \(P\times_G V\) is an [[fiber-bundles/associated-vector-bundle|associated vector bundle]].

2. **Recovering a vector bundle from its frame bundle.**
   For a rank \(n\) vector bundle \(E\to M\) with frame bundle \(P=\operatorname{Fr}(E)\), take \(F=\mathbb R^n\) with the standard left \(GL(n)\)-action. Then
   \[
   \operatorname{Fr}(E)\times_{GL(n)}\mathbb R^n \cong E
   \]
   canonically (this is the basic example behind [[fiber-bundles/tfae-vector-bundle-connections-via-frame-bundles-rank-n-vector-bundle-em|frame-bundle descriptions of vector-bundle data]]).

3. **Hopf bundle and the Hopf [[fiber-bundles/line-bundle|line bundle]].**
   For the [[fiber-bundles/hopf-fibration-s3s2-as-a-principal-u-bundle|Hopf fibration]] \(S^3\to S^2\) (a principal \(U(1)\)-bundle) and \(F=\mathbb C\) with the usual left \(U(1)\)-action by scalar multiplication, the associated bundle \(S^3\times_{U(1)}\mathbb C\to S^2\) is the standard nontrivial [[fiber-bundles/complex-vector-bundle|complex line bundle]] over \(S^2\).
