Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]], and let \(\omega_0,\omega_1\) be two [[fiber-bundles/principal-connection|principal connections]] on \(P\) with connection 1-forms (also denoted) \(\omega_0,\omega_1\in \Omega^1(P;\mathfrak g)\) as in [[fiber-bundles/connection-1-form-on-a-principal-bundle|connection 1-forms on principal bundles]]. Write their curvature 2-forms as \(\Omega_0,\Omega_1\in \Omega^2(P;\mathfrak g)\) (see [[fiber-bundles/curvature-2-form-of-a-principal-connection|curvature 2-forms of principal connections]]).

Let \(p\in \operatorname{Sym}^k(\mathfrak g^*)^G\) be an \(\operatorname{Ad}\)-invariant homogeneous polynomial of degree \(k\), so that the associated [[fiber-bundles/chernweil-form|Chern Weil form]] \(p(\Omega)\) is a closed \(2k\)-form on \(M\) (via basicness on \(P\)), as in [[fiber-bundles/chernweil-theorem-p-is-closed-and-its-de-rham-class-is-independent-of-connection|the Chern Weil theorem]].

Define the difference
\[
\eta := \omega_1-\omega_0 \in \Omega^1(P;\mathfrak g).
\]
By [[fiber-bundles/lemma-difference-of-two-principal-connections-is-tensorial|tensoriality of differences of principal connections]], \(\eta\) is horizontal and equivariant (hence “tensorial”), so it corresponds to an \(\operatorname{ad}(P)\)-valued 1-form on \(M\).

Consider the straight-line path of connections
\[
\omega_t := \omega_0 + t\,\eta,\qquad t\in[0,1],
\]
with curvature
\[
\Omega_t := d\omega_t + \tfrac12[\omega_t\wedge \omega_t]
\]
(compare [[fiber-bundles/cartans-second-structure-equation|Cartan's second structure equation]]).

### Change-of-connection (transgression) formula
Define the transgression form
\[
T_p(\omega_0,\omega_1)
:= k \int_0^1 p\bigl(\eta \wedge \Omega_t^{k-1}\bigr)\,dt,
\]
a \((2k-1)\)-form on \(P\) which is basic and therefore descends to a \((2k-1)\)-form on \(M\) (often also denoted \(T_p(\omega_0,\omega_1)\)).

Then the characteristic forms satisfy
\[
p(\Omega_1) - p(\Omega_0) \;=\; d\,T_p(\omega_0,\omega_1),
\]
so the two forms differ by an exact form on \(M\). In particular, the de Rham class of \(p(\Omega)\) does not depend on the chosen connection, which is the mechanism behind [[fiber-bundles/corollary-chernweil-characteristic-classes-are-invariants-of-the-principal-bundle|Chern Weil characteristic classes being invariants of the principal bundle]].

## Remarks

This construction is the standard transgression mechanism (see [[fiber-bundles/transgression-form|transgression forms]] and [[fiber-bundles/transgression-theorem-p-p-is-exact|the transgression theorem]]), and in low degrees it produces the usual [[fiber-bundles/chernsimons-form|Chern Simons forms]].

## Examples
1. **Degree 1 (abelian-style) case.**
   If \(k=1\) and \(p:\mathfrak g\to\mathbb R\) is an \(\operatorname{Ad}\)-invariant linear functional, then
   \[
   T_p(\omega_0,\omega_1)=p(\eta),\qquad p(\Omega_1)-p(\Omega_0)=d\,p(\eta).
   \]
   For \(G=U(1)\) this recovers the familiar fact that changing a connection 1-form changes the curvature 2-form by an exact 2-form (compare the local picture in [[fiber-bundles/local-connection-1-form|local connection 1-forms]]).

2. **Degree 2 and the Chern Simons 3-form.**
   For \(k=2\) and an invariant quadratic polynomial \(p\) (for instance a suitably normalized trace form on a matrix Lie algebra), the transgression is a 3-form
   \[
   T_p(\omega_0,\omega_1) = 2\int_0^1 p(\eta\wedge \Omega_t)\,dt,
   \]
   and the formula says \(p(\Omega_1)-p(\Omega_0)\) is exact with this primitive. On a trivial bundle, taking \(\omega_0=0\) and \(\omega_1=A\) yields the usual Chern Simons expression in terms of \(A\) and \(dA\), matching the standard [[fiber-bundles/chernsimons-form|Chern Simons form]] on a chart.

3. **Pontryagin forms from different connections.**
   Let \(E\to M\) be a real vector bundle with two [[fiber-bundles/connection-on-a-vector-bundle|vector bundle connections]] \(\nabla^0,\nabla^1\). Using the induced connections on the [[fiber-bundles/frame-bundle-frame-bundle-of-a-rank-n-vector-bundle|frame bundle]] (via [[fiber-bundles/construction-connection-on-fr-induced-by-a-vector-bundle-connection|the induced principal connection construction]]), the change-of-connection formula implies that the associated Pontryagin forms differ by an exact form. Hence the resulting [[fiber-bundles/pontryagin-class|Pontryagin classes]] are independent of the chosen connection.
