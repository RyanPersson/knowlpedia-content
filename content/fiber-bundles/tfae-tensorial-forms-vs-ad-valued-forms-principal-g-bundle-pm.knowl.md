Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]] over a [[fiber-bundles/smooth-manifold|smooth manifold]] \(M\), where \(G\) is a [[fiber-bundles/lie-group|Lie group]] with [[lie-groups/lie-algebra|Lie algebra]] \(\mathfrak g\).

The **[[fiber-bundles/construction-adjoint-lie-algebra-bundle-ad|adjoint bundle]]** of \(P\) is the [[fiber-bundles/associated-vector-bundle|associated vector bundle]]
\[
\operatorname{ad}(P):=P\times_{\operatorname{Ad}}\mathfrak g \;\longrightarrow\; M,
\]
where \(G\) acts on \(\mathfrak g\) by the adjoint representation \(\operatorname{Ad}\).

A \(\mathfrak g\)-valued [[fiber-bundles/differential-k-form|differential k-form]] \(\omega\in\Omega^k(P;\mathfrak g)\) is called **tensorial of type \(\operatorname{Ad}\)** if it satisfies:

1. **Horizontality:** \(\omega_p(v_1,\dots,v_k)=0\) whenever at least one \(v_i\in\ker(d\pi_p)\) (i.e., a vertical tangent vector).
2. **Equivariance:** for every \(g\in G\),
   \[
   (R_g)^*\omega = \operatorname{Ad}(g^{-1})\,\omega,
   \]
   where \(R_g:P\to P\) is the right action.

Write \(\Omega^k_{\mathrm{tens}}(P;\mathfrak g)\) for the vector space of such tensorial forms.

## Theorem (TFAE: tensorial forms vs ad(P)-valued forms)
There is a natural vector space isomorphism
\[
\Omega^k_{\mathrm{tens}}(P;\mathfrak g)\;\cong\;\Omega^k\!\bigl(M;\operatorname{ad}(P)\bigr).
\]

More explicitly:

- Given \(\omega\in\Omega^k_{\mathrm{tens}}(P;\mathfrak g)\), define \(\alpha\in\Omega^k(M;\operatorname{ad}(P))\) by
  \[
  \alpha_x(u_1,\dots,u_k)\;:=\;\bigl[p,\;\omega_p(\tilde u_1,\dots,\tilde u_k)\bigr]\in \operatorname{ad}(P)_x,
  \]
  where \(p\in P\) satisfies \(\pi(p)=x\), and \(\tilde u_i\in T_pP\) are any tangent vectors with \(d\pi_p(\tilde u_i)=u_i\).
  This is well-defined because vertical components do not affect \(\omega\) (horizontality) and changing \(p\) in the fiber changes \(\omega\) by \(\operatorname{Ad}(g^{-1})\) (equivariance), exactly matching the associated-bundle identification.

- Conversely, given \(\alpha\in\Omega^k(M;\operatorname{ad}(P))\), define \(\omega\in\Omega^k(P;\mathfrak g)\) by requiring that for \(p\in P\) and \(v_i\in T_pP\),
  \[
  \alpha_{\pi(p)}(d\pi_p v_1,\dots,d\pi_p v_k)=\bigl[p,\;\omega_p(v_1,\dots,v_k)\bigr]\in\operatorname{ad}(P)_{\pi(p)}.
  \]
  This forces \(\omega\) to be horizontal, and the associated-bundle relation forces \(\operatorname{Ad}\)-equivariance.

These constructions are inverse to each other and are natural with respect to bundle morphisms covering the identity on \(M\).

A key application is that the [[fiber-bundles/curvature|curvature]] of a [[fiber-bundles/principal-connection|principal connection]] is tensorial of type \(\operatorname{Ad}\), hence canonically corresponds to an \(\operatorname{ad}(P)\)-valued 2-form on the base.

## Examples
1. **Curvature descends to the base.**  
   If \(\Theta\) is a principal connection on \(P\) with curvature \(F_\Theta\in\Omega^2(P;\mathfrak g)\), then \(F_\Theta\) is horizontal and \(\operatorname{Ad}\)-equivariant. The theorem identifies \(F_\Theta\) with a unique element of \(\Omega^2(M;\operatorname{ad}(P))\).

2. **Trivial bundle case.**  
   On the [[fiber-bundles/trivial-principal-bundle-mgm|trivial principal bundle]] \(P=M\times G\), the adjoint bundle is canonically isomorphic to \(M\times\mathfrak g\). Under this identification, a tensorial \(\omega\) corresponds to an ordinary \(\mathfrak g\)-valued form on \(M\) (written in a chosen [[fiber-bundles/section-of-a-fiber-bundle|global section]]), and the correspondence is given by pullback along the section and associated-bundle identification.

3. **Scalar “basic” forms as a special case.**  
   If one replaces \(\mathfrak g\) by a trivial \(G\)-representation (so equivariance becomes \(G\)-invariance), then horizontal \(G\)-invariant forms on \(P\) correspond exactly to ordinary differential forms on \(M\) via pullback along \(\pi\).
