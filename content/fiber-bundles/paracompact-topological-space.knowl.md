Let \(X\) be a topological space.

An open cover \(\{U_i\}_{i\in I}\) of \(X\) is **locally finite** if every point \(x\in X\) has a neighborhood \(V_x\) that meets only finitely many sets \(U_i\).

The space \(X\) is **paracompact** if every open cover of \(X\) admits a locally finite open refinement (i.e., there is a locally finite open cover \(\{V_j\}_{j\in J}\) such that each \(V_j\subset U_{i(j)}\) for some \(i(j)\)).

Paracompactness is one of the key hypotheses that ensures the existence of [[fiber-bundles/partition-of-unity-subordinate-to-an-open-cover|partitions of unity subordinate to open covers]] and underlies many global constructions in differential geometry.

## Examples
1. **Metric spaces.**  
   Every metric space is paracompact. In particular, all smooth manifolds modeled on \(\mathbb R^n\) with their usual topology are paracompact when they satisfy the standard countability hypotheses.

2. **Compact Hausdorff spaces.**  
   Every compact Hausdorff space is paracompact: open covers admit finite subcovers, hence are automatically locally finite.

3. **CW complexes.**  
   CW complexes are paracompact, which is one reason the [[fiber-bundles/classifying-space-bg|classifying space]] technology behaves well for bundles over CW-type bases.
