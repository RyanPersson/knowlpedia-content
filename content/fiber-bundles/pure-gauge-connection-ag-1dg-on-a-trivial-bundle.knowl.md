Let \(P=M\times G\to M\) be a trivial principal bundle, where \(G\) is a Lie group with Lie algebra \(\mathfrak g\). Given a smooth map \(g:M\to G\), the **pure gauge potential** associated with \(g\) is
\[
A := g^{-1}dg \in \Omega^1(M;\mathfrak g),
\]
the pullback of the left Maurer–Cartan form along \(g\). With the stated gauge convention, it is the transform of the product connection \(A=0\).

## Flatness
Viewed as the local gauge potential of a [[fiber-bundles/principal-connection|principal connection]] on \(M\times G\), the curvature is
\[
F = dA + \tfrac12[A\wedge A],
\]
and one has \(F=0\) for \(A=g^{-1}dg\) by the Maurer–Cartan identity. Hence pure gauge connections are flat.

In particular, their holonomy is trivial up to the natural basepoint identifications (they are globally gauge-equivalent to the product connection).

## Examples
1. **Abelian case.**
   For \(G=U(1)\), write \(g=e^{if}\) for a smooth real-valued function \(f\) (locally or globally when possible). Then \(A\) is (up to the conventional factor of \(i\)) the 1-form \(df\), and the curvature vanishes because \(d(df)=0\).

2. **Matrix groups.**
   For \(G=\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\) and a smooth map \(g:M\to \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\), the potential is the matrix-valued 1-form \(A=g^{-1}dg\), flat by the same identity.

3. **Local normal form of flat connections.**
   On a contractible open set \(U\subset M\), any flat connection can be written (after choosing a trivialization) as \(A=g^{-1}dg\) for some smooth \(g:U\to G\).
