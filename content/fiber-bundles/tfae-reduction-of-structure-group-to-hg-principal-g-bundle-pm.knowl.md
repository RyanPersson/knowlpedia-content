Let \(\pi:P\to M\) be a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]] with structure group \(G\), and let \(H\subset G\) be a Lie subgroup (see [[lie-groups/lie-subgroup|Lie subgroup]]). A **reduction of structure group to \(H\)** means, informally, that \(P\) can be described using \(H\) as the structure group instead of \(G\) (see [[fiber-bundles/reduction-of-structure-group|reduction of structure group]]).

## Theorem (TFAE: reduction to H)
The following are equivalent:

1. (**Principal H-subbundle**)  
   There exists a [[fiber-bundles/principal-h-subbundle|principal H-subbundle]] \(Q\subset P\) such that \(Q\to M\) is a principal \(H\)-bundle and the inclusion \(Q\hookrightarrow P\) is \(H\)-equivariant (with \(H\) acting on \(P\) through the inclusion \(H\subset G\)).

2. (**Associated bundle model**)  
   There exists a principal \(H\)-bundle \(Q\to M\) such that \(P\) is isomorphic (as a principal \(G\)-bundle) to the extension of structure group
   \[
   P \cong Q\times_H G
   \]
   (compare [[fiber-bundles/extension-of-structure-group|extension of structure group]]).

3. (**H-valued transition functions**)  
   There exists a bundle atlas for \(P\) whose transition functions take values in \(H\subset G\). Equivalently, the cocycle of transition functions is represented by an \(H\)-valued cocycle (see [[fiber-bundles/principal-bundle-transition-function|principal bundle transition functions]] and [[fiber-bundles/reduction-by-cocycle-structure-group-reduces-to-h-iff-transition-functions-can-be-chosen-h-valued|reduction by cocycle]]). This is the transition-function viewpoint used in [[fiber-bundles/construction-reduction-of-structure-group-to-h-via-transition-functions-valued-in-h|constructing reductions via H-valued transition functions]].

4. (**Section of the coset bundle**)  
   Let \(G\) act on the homogeneous space \(G/H\) by left translation. Form the associated bundle
   \[
   P/H \;:=\; P\times_G (G/H),
   \]
   sometimes called the bundle of cosets (compare [[fiber-bundles/bundle-of-orbits|bundle of orbits]] in the special case of homogeneous fibers). Then \(P\) admits a reduction of structure group to \(H\) if and only if \(P/H\to M\) admits a smooth [[fiber-bundles/section-of-a-fiber-bundle|global section]].

In (4), given a reduction \(Q\subset P\), the corresponding section of \(P/H\) sends \(x\in M\) to the coset represented by any \(q\in Q_x\). Conversely, a section selects an \(H\)-orbit in each fiber of \(P\), and its preimage defines the reduced subbundle \(Q\).

## Examples
1. **Riemannian metric reduces GL(n) to O(n).**  
   Let \(E\to M\) be a rank-\(n\) real vector bundle with frame bundle \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\) (see [[fiber-bundles/frame-bundle-frame-bundle-of-a-rank-n-vector-bundle|frame bundle]]). A [[fiber-bundles/bundle-metric|bundle metric]] on \(E\) is equivalent to a reduction of \(\mathrm{Fr}(E)\) from \(GL(n)\) to \(O(n)\), whose reduced bundle is the orthonormal frame bundle (see [[fiber-bundles/orthonormal-frame-bundle-reduction-of-the-frame-bundle|orthonormal frame bundle reduction]] and [[fiber-bundles/example-reduction-of-gl-structure-to-o-using-a-bundle-metric|metric reduction example]]).

2. **Orientation reduces GL(n) to GL+(n).**  
   An [[fiber-bundles/orientation-of-a-real-vector-bundle|orientation of a real vector bundle]] is equivalent to a reduction of the structure group from \(GL(n)\) to the identity component \(GL^+(n)\). In transition-function terms, this means one can choose local frames so that all transition matrices have positive determinant.

3. **Unitary to special unitary reduction.**  
   For a complex Hermitian vector bundle, the unitary frame bundle gives a reduction to \(U(n)\) (see [[fiber-bundles/unitary-frame-bundle-reduction|unitary frame bundle reduction]]). A further reduction to \(SU(n)\) corresponds to choosing a trivialization of the determinant bundle compatible with the Hermitian structure, producing the [[fiber-bundles/special-unitary-frame-bundle-reduction|special unitary frame bundle reduction]].
