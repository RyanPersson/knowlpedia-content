Let $\pi:P\to M$ be a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]]. In this project we reserve the notation $\operatorname{Ad}(P)$ for the associated bundle with fiber the group $G$ itself, where $G$ acts on $G$ by conjugation.

## Convention
We define the **adjoint bundle**
$$
\operatorname{Ad}(P):=P\times_G G
$$
using the [[fiber-bundles/conjugation-action-of-a-lie-group-on-itself|conjugation action]] of $G$ on itself:
$$
g\cdot h := ghg^{-1}\qquad (g,h\in G),
$$
together with the general convention that [[fiber-bundles/convention-associated-bundles-use-a-left-g-action-on-the-fiber-f|associated bundles use a left G-action on the fiber]] while $P$ carries a right principal action (see [[fiber-bundles/convention-principal-bundles-use-a-right-g-action-on-p|right action convention]]).

This is compatible with the construction in [[fiber-bundles/construction-adjoint-bundle-ad|construction of the adjoint bundle]], and it is distinct from the **adjoint Lie algebra bundle**
$$
\operatorname{ad}(P):=P\times_G \mathfrak g,
$$
which uses the [[lie-groups/adjoint-representation-of-a-lie-algebra|adjoint representation on the Lie algebra]]; see [[fiber-bundles/construction-adjoint-lie-algebra-bundle-ad|construction of ad(P)]].

Because conjugation is by group automorphisms, $\operatorname{Ad}(P)$ is a bundle of Lie groups (fiberwise multiplication is well-defined). In particular, the [[fiber-bundles/gauge-group|gauge group]] can be identified with the smooth sections of $\operatorname{Ad}(P)$ once this convention is fixed.

## Examples
1. **Trivial principal bundle.**
   If $P\cong M\times G$, then $\operatorname{Ad}(P)\cong M\times G$ as a bundle of groups (choosing the obvious global section produces the identification).

2. **Frame bundle interpretation.**
   If $E\to M$ is a rank $n$ vector bundle and $P=\operatorname{Fr}(E)$ is its [[fiber-bundles/construction-frame-bundle-fr-of-a-vector-bundle-e|frame bundle]], then
   $$
   \operatorname{Ad}(P)=\operatorname{Fr}(E)\times_{GL(n)}GL(n)
   $$
   can be identified with the bundle $\operatorname{Aut}(E)\to M$ of fiberwise linear automorphisms of $E$ (conjugation is exactly change-of-basis for matrices).

3. **Abelian structure group.**
   If $G$ is abelian, conjugation is trivial, so $\operatorname{Ad}(P)\cong M\times G$ canonically. For instance, for the [[fiber-bundles/hopf-fibration-s3s2-as-a-principal-u-bundle|Hopf fibration]] as a principal $U(1)$-bundle, the adjoint bundle is $S^2\times U(1)$.
