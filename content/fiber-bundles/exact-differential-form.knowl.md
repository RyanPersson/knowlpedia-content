Let \(M\) be a [[fiber-bundles/smooth-manifold|smooth manifold]]. Exactness is defined using the [[fiber-bundles/exterior-derivative|exterior derivative]] on [[fiber-bundles/differential-k-form|differential forms]].

A form \(\omega\in\Omega^k(M)\) is **exact** if there exists \(\eta\in\Omega^{k-1}(M)\) such that
\[
\omega = d\eta.
\]
The vector space of exact \(k\)-forms is
\[
B^k(M) \coloneqq \operatorname{im}\!\bigl(d:\Omega^{k-1}(M)\to\Omega^k(M)\bigr).
\]

Exact forms are automatically [[fiber-bundles/closed-differential-form|closed]] because \(d^2=0\). In the [[fiber-bundles/de-rham-cohomology-group|de Rham cohomology group]] \(H^k_{\mathrm{dR}}(M)\), exact forms represent the zero class.

## Examples
1. **Differentials of functions are exact 1-forms.**
   For any smooth function \(f\in C^\infty(M)\), the 1-form \(df\) is exact by definition, with \(\eta=f\) viewed as a 0-form.

2. **A basic exact 2-form on \(\mathbb{R}^3\).**
   On \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with coordinates \((x,y,z)\),
   \[
   dx\wedge dy = d(x\,dy),
   \]
   so \(dx\wedge dy\) is exact.

3. **A closed non-example (not exact globally).**
   On \(U=\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{0\}\), the 1-form
   \[
   \omega=\frac{-y\,dx + x\,dy}{x^2+y^2}
   \]
   is [[fiber-bundles/closed-differential-form|closed]] but not exact; equivalently, it defines a nonzero class in the [[fiber-bundles/de-rham-cohomology-group|de Rham cohomology]] of \(U\).
