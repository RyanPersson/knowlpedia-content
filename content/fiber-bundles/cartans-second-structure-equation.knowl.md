Let \(M\) be an \(n\)-dimensional [[fiber-bundles/smooth-manifold|smooth manifold]] and let \(\pi:F(M)\to M\) be its frame bundle, a [[fiber-bundles/principal-g-bundle|principal G-bundle]] with structure group \(G=\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})\). Fix a [[fiber-bundles/principal-connection|principal connection]] \(\omega\in\Omega^1(F(M);\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R}))\), where \(\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})\) is the [[lie-groups/lie-algebra|Lie algebra]] of \(G\).

## Statement (frame bundle formulation)

The [[fiber-bundles/curvature|curvature]] of \(\omega\) is the \(\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})\)-valued \(2\)-form \(\Omega\in\Omega^2(F(M);\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R}))\) defined by
\[
\Omega \;:=\; d\omega \;+\;\tfrac12[\omega\wedge\omega].
\]

This identity is **Cartan’s second structure equation**, where \(d\) is the [[fiber-bundles/exterior-derivative|exterior derivative]] and the bracket wedge is defined on vector fields by
\[
[\omega\wedge\omega](V,W)
\;=\;[\omega(V),\omega(W)]-[\omega(W),\omega(V)]
\;=\;2[\omega(V),\omega(W)],
\]
using the [[fiber-bundles/lie-bracket|Lie bracket]] on \(\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})\).

The form \(\Omega\) is horizontal and \(G\)-equivariant. Under the usual correspondence between principal connections on \(F(M)\) and linear connections on \(TM\), \(\Omega\) encodes the [[differential-geometry/riemann-curvature-tensor|Riemann curvature tensor]] of the induced connection on the [[fiber-bundles/tangent-bundle|tangent bundle]].

## Examples

1. **Flat connection in a global frame.**  
   If \(M=\mathbb{R}^n\) with its standard frame and \(\omega=0\), then \(\Omega=0\) by the second structure equation.

2. **Constant sectional curvature model.**  
   For the round sphere with its Levi-Civita connection, in a local orthonormal coframe one has curvature \(2\)-forms of the schematic shape
   \[
   \Omega^i{}_j = K\,\theta^i\wedge\theta^j,
   \]
   reflecting constant sectional curvature \(K>0\).

3. **Product connections.**  
   If \(M=M_1\times M_2\) and the connection on \(TM\cong TM_1\oplus TM_2\) is the product of connections on the factors, then \(\Omega\) is block-diagonal with blocks given by the curvature forms from each factor, and there are no mixed curvature terms.
