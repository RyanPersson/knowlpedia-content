Let $R$ be a [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative ring]]. The **Krull dimension** of $R$, denoted $\dim R$, is the supremum of integers $n\ge 0$ for which there exists a strictly increasing chain of prime ideals
\[
\mathfrak p_0 \subsetneq \mathfrak p_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak p_n
\]
in $R$. If no such finite supremum exists, one writes $\dim R = \infty$.

## Equivalent characterizations

Equivalently, $\dim R$ is the Krull dimension of the topological space [[algebra-commutative/prime-spectrum|\operatorname{Spec}(R)]] with its [[algebra-commutative/zariski-topology|Zariski topology]].

## Remarks

The Krull dimension can also be expressed in terms of heights: for each prime $\mathfrak p$, its [[algebra-commutative/height-of-prime|height]] $\operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak p)$ is the supremum of lengths of prime chains ending at $\mathfrak p$, and one has
\[
\dim R = \sup_{\mathfrak p\in \operatorname{Spec}(R)} \operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak p).
\]
Moreover, $\operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak p)$ agrees with the dimension of the [[algebra-commutative/localization-at-prime|localization $R_{\mathfrak p}$]].

### Examples

1. **Fields and Artinian rings have dimension $0$.**
   If $k$ is a [[algebra-rings/field|field]], the only prime ideal is $(0)$, so $\dim k=0$. More generally, if $R$ is an [[algebra-commutative/artinian-ring|Artinian ring]], then every prime ideal is maximal and there are no nontrivial chains of primes, so $\dim R=0$.

2. **Dimension $1$: $\mathbb{Z}$ and $k[x]$.**
   In $\mathbb{Z}$ there are chains $(0)\subsetneq (p)$, but no longer chains, so $\dim \mathbb{Z}=1$. Similarly, for a field $k$, the ring $k[x]$ has chains $(0)\subsetneq (f)$ (with $f$ irreducible), but no longer ones, hence $\dim k[x]=1$.

3. **Polynomial rings.**
   For a field $k$, the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ has Krull dimension $n$. For instance, in $k[x,y]$ one has the chain
   \[
   (0)\subsetneq (x)\subsetneq (x,y),
   \]
   showing $\dim k[x,y]\ge 2$, and in fact equality holds.
