**Prime avoidance lemma.** Let \(R\) be a [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative ring]], and let \(I,\mathfrak a_1,\dots,\mathfrak a_n\) be ideals of \(R\). Assume that \(\mathfrak a_2,\dots,\mathfrak a_n\) are prime. If
\[
I \subseteq \mathfrak a_1 \cup \mathfrak a_2 \cup \cdots \cup \mathfrak a_n,
\]
then \(I\subseteq\mathfrak a_j\) for some \(j\in\{1,\dots,n\}\).

A common special case (often the only one needed) is:

> If \(\mathfrak p_1,\dots,\mathfrak p_n\) are prime ideals and
> \[
> I \subseteq \mathfrak p_1\cup\cdots\cup \mathfrak p_n,
> \]
> then \(I\subseteq \mathfrak p_i\) for some \(i\).

## Equivalent characterizations

Equivalently (and often how it is used): if \(I\) is an ideal **not** contained in any of the prime ideals \(\mathfrak p_1,\dots,\mathfrak p_n\), then there exists an element \(x\in I\) such that \(x\notin \mathfrak p_1\cup\cdots\cup \mathfrak p_n\).

## Remarks

This “element-choosing” form underlies many constructions, for example when passing to a [[algebra-commutative/localization-ring|localization]] to avoid certain primes or when proving facts about basic open sets in [[algebra-commutative/zariski-topology|the Zariski topology]].

## Examples

1. **In \(\mathbb Z\).**
   Take \(R=\mathbb Z\), \(I=(6)\), and \(\mathfrak p_1=(2)\), \(\mathfrak p_2=(3)\) (both prime ideals). Then
   \[
   (6)\subseteq (2)\cup(3)
   \]
   because every multiple of \(6\) is divisible by \(2\) (and also by \(3\)). Prime avoidance correctly concludes that \((6)\subseteq (2)\) or \((6)\subseteq (3)\) (in fact both hold).

2. **Choosing an element outside a finite union.**
   In \(R=k[x,y]\) over a field \(k\), let \(\mathfrak p_1=(x)\) and \(\mathfrak p_2=(y)\), both prime. The ideal \(I=(x,y)\) is **not** contained in \(\mathfrak p_1\) and is **not** contained in \(\mathfrak p_2\). Prime avoidance therefore guarantees an element of \(I\) outside \(\mathfrak p_1\cup\mathfrak p_2\); concretely, \(x+y\in (x,y)\) but \(x+y\notin (x)\) and \(x+y\notin (y)\).

3. **Why finiteness matters (failure for infinite unions).**
   Let \(R=k[x_1,x_2,\dots]\) be a polynomial ring in infinitely many variables over a field \(k\), and let
   \[
   I=(x_1,x_2,\dots).
   \]
   For each \(n\), the ideal \(\mathfrak p_n=(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) is prime. Every element of \(I\) involves only finitely many variables, so it belongs to \(\mathfrak p_n\) for some \(n\), hence
   \[
   I \subseteq \bigcup_{n\ge 1}\mathfrak p_n.
   \]
   But \(I\) is not contained in any single \(\mathfrak p_n\) (since \(x_{n+1}\in I\) but \(x_{n+1}\notin \mathfrak p_n\)). This shows the lemma is genuinely a **finite**-union phenomenon.
