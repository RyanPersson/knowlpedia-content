Let \(R\) be a [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative ring]].

\(R\) is **Artinian** if it satisfies the *descending chain condition* (DCC) on ideals: for every chain
\[
I_1 \supseteq I_2 \supseteq I_3 \supseteq \cdots
\]
there exists \(N\) such that \(I_n=I_N\) for all \(n\ge N\).

## Equivalent characterizations

Equivalently, every nonempty set of ideals of \(R\) has a minimal element under inclusion.

## Key consequences in the commutative case
- Every commutative Artinian ring is [[algebra-commutative/noetherian-ring|Noetherian]]. In particular, many finiteness tools become available automatically.
- A commutative Artinian ring has [[algebra-commutative/krull-dimension|Krull dimension]] \(0\): every prime ideal is maximal. In terms of spectra, \(\operatorname{Spec}(R)\) is a finite discrete space and coincides with the [[algebra-commutative/maximal-spectrum|maximal spectrum]].
- The Jacobson radical (the [[algebra-commutative/jacobson-radical-intersection-maximals|intersection of maximal ideals]]) is nilpotent, and \(R\) decomposes as a finite product of Artinian local rings; this is closely related to the [[algebra-rings/chinese-remainder-theorem|Chinese remainder theorem]].

## Examples
1. **Fields.**
   Any [[algebra-rings/field|field]] is Artinian: its only ideals are \((0)\) and \((1)\).

2. **Finite quotients of \(\mathbb{Z}\).**
   \(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) is Artinian (it is finite, so it has only finitely many ideals). For instance, \(\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z}\) is Artinian.

3. **Truncated polynomial rings.**
   If \(k\) is a field, then \(k[x]/(x^n)\) is Artinian: the ideals are \((0)\subset (x^{n-1})\subset \cdots \subset (x)\subset (1)\), so every descending chain stabilizes.

(As a contrast, \(k[x]\) is Noetherian but not Artinian: the descending chain \((x)\supset (x^2)\supset (x^3)\supset \cdots\) never stabilizes.)
