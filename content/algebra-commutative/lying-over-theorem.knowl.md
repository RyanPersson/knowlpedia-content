Let $A\subseteq B$ be an extension of [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative rings]]. The extension is an [[algebra-commutative/integral-extension|integral extension]] if every element of $B$ is integral over $A$.

**Theorem (Lying over).**
Assume $A\subseteq B$ is an [[algebra-commutative/integral-extension|integral extension]]. Then for every prime ideal $\mathfrak p\subseteq A$ there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak q\subseteq B$ such that
\[
\mathfrak q\cap A=\mathfrak p.
\]

## Equivalent characterizations

Equivalently, the natural map of [[algebra-commutative/prime-spectrum|prime spectra]]
\[
\operatorname{Spec}(B)\longrightarrow \operatorname{Spec}(A),\qquad \mathfrak q\mapsto \mathfrak q\cap A
\]
is surjective. In particular, every maximal ideal of $A$ is the contraction of some maximal ideal of $B$, so the induced map on [[algebra-commutative/maximal-spectrum|maximal spectra]] is also surjective.

## Remarks

Lying-over is frequently used as the existence input for [[algebra-commutative/going-up-theorem|going up]] and, under extra hypotheses, for [[algebra-commutative/going-down-theorem|going down]].

### Examples
1. **Gaussian integers over the integers.**
   The inclusion $\mathbb Z\subset \mathbb Z[i]$ is integral (since $i$ satisfies $T^2+1=0$). For the prime ideal $(5)\subset\mathbb Z$, lying-over guarantees a prime $\mathfrak q\subset \mathbb Z[i]$ with $\mathfrak q\cap\mathbb Z=(5)$. Concretely, one can take $\mathfrak q=(2+i)$ (or $\mathfrak q=(2-i)$), both lying over $(5)$.

2. **A simple subring of a polynomial ring.**
   Let $k$ be a [[algebra-rings/field|field]] and set $A=k[t^2]\subset B=k[t]$. The element $t$ is integral over $A$ (it satisfies $T^2-t^2=0$), so $A\subset B$ is integral. The prime ideal $(t^2)\subset A$ is the contraction of the prime ideal $(t)\subset B$.

3. **Adjoining a square root.**
   Let $A=k[x]$ and $B=k[x,y]/(y^2-x)$. The image of $y$ is integral over $A$ (it satisfies $T^2-x=0$), hence $A\subset B$ is integral. The prime ideal $(x)\subset A$ is the contraction of the prime ideal $(x,y)\subset B$.
