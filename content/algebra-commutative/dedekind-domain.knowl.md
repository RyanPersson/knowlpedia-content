A **Dedekind domain** is a central object in commutative algebra and algebraic number theory.

An integral domain $R$ is a **Dedekind domain** if:
1. $R$ is a [[algebra-commutative/noetherian-ring|Noetherian ring]];
2. $R$ is an [[algebra-commutative/integrally-closed-domain|integrally closed domain]];
3. $R$ has [[algebra-commutative/krull-dimension|Krull dimension]] $1$ (equivalently, every nonzero prime ideal has [[algebra-commutative/height-of-prime|height]] $1$, hence is maximal).

Condition (3) can be read as: “the only prime ideals properly contained in a nonzero prime are $(0)$.”

## Equivalent and characteristic properties
For a domain $R$, the following are standard characterizations of Dedekind domains:
- Every nonzero proper ideal factors as a product of prime ideals, and this factorization is unique up to ordering.
- For every nonzero prime ideal $\mathfrak p$, the localization $R_\mathfrak p$ (see [[algebra-commutative/localization-at-prime|localization at a prime]]) is a [[algebra-commutative/dvr|discrete valuation ring]]. In fact, this local DVR structure controls the prime-power factorization of ideals.

## Examples
1. **The integers.**  
   $\mathbb{Z}$ is a Dedekind domain: it is Noetherian, integrally closed in $\mathbb{Q}$, and has dimension $1$. (More generally, any PID that is not a field is Dedekind; for instance, any [[algebra-rings/euclidean-domain|Euclidean domain]] is a PID by [[algebra-rings/euclidean-implies-pid|Euclidean ⇒ PID]] and hence Dedekind.)

2. **A principal ideal domain of dimension one.**  
   For a field $k$, the polynomial ring $k[t]$ is a PID, hence Dedekind.

3. **Rings of integers in number fields.**  
   If $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is a number field and $\mathcal O_K$ is its ring of integers, then $\mathcal O_K$ is a Dedekind domain (a key reason prime ideal factorization replaces unique factorization of elements).

## Non-example
- $k[x,y]$ (two variables over a field $k$) is Noetherian and integrally closed, but it has Krull dimension $2$, so it is not Dedekind.
