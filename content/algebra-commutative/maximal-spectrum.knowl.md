Let \(R\) be a [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative ring]]. A **maximal ideal** of \(R\) is a proper ideal \(\mathfrak m\subsetneq R\) such that there is no ideal strictly between \(\mathfrak m\) and \(R\); equivalently, \(R/\mathfrak m\) is a [[algebra-rings/field|field]].

The **maximal spectrum** of \(R\) is the set
\[
\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R) := \{\mathfrak m \subset R \mid \mathfrak m \text{ is a maximal ideal}\}.
\]

There is always an inclusion \(\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\subseteq \operatorname{Spec}(R)\) (see [[algebra-commutative/prime-spectrum|prime spectrum]]), since every maximal ideal is prime. One typically topologizes \(\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\) by the subspace topology induced from the [[algebra-commutative/zariski-topology|Zariski topology on \(\operatorname{Spec}(R)\)]]. Concretely, for an ideal \(I\subseteq R\) the corresponding closed subset of \(\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\) is
\[
V(I)\cap \operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)=\{\mathfrak m\in \operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\mid I\subseteq \mathfrak m\}.
\]

A point \(\mathfrak m\in \operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\) has residue field \(R/\mathfrak m\), which agrees with the [[algebra-commutative/residue-field|residue field]] at \(\mathfrak m\).

### Examples

1. **Local rings.**
   If \(R\) is a [[algebra-commutative/local-ring|local ring]], it has a unique maximal ideal (see [[algebra-commutative/maximal-ideal-local-ring|the characterization of local rings by a unique maximal ideal]]), hence \(\operatorname{MaxSpec}(R)\) is a single point.

2. **The integers.**
   For \(R=\mathbb{Z}\), the maximal ideals are exactly \((p)\) for primes \(p\). Thus
   \[
   \operatorname{MaxSpec}(\mathbb{Z})=\{(p)\mid p\ \text{prime}\},
   \]
   which is \(\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})\) with the generic point \((0)\) removed.

3. **Polynomial rings over an algebraically closed field.**
   If \(k\) is algebraically closed and \(R=k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\), then the [[algebra-commutative/nullstellensatz-variety-correspondence|Nullstellensatz]] identifies maximal ideals with points \(a=(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in k^n\) via
   \[
   a \longleftrightarrow (x_1-a_1,\dots,x_n-a_n).
   \]
   In this sense, \(\operatorname{MaxSpec}(k[x_1,\dots,x_n])\) recovers affine \(n\)-space over \(k\) as a set, and its induced topology is the classical Zariski topology on \(k^n\).
