Let \(R\) be a [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative ring]] and let \(S\subseteq R\) be a [[algebra-commutative/multiplicative-set|multiplicative set]]. The [[algebra-commutative/localization-ring|localization]] \(S^{-1}R\) comes with a canonical ring homomorphism
\[
\iota:R\to S^{-1}R,\qquad r\mapsto \frac{r}{1}.
\]

**Theorem (elements of \(S\) become units).**
For every \(s\in S\), the element \(\iota(s)=s/1\) is a unit in \(S^{-1}R\), with inverse \(1/s\). In particular, every fraction can be rewritten as
\[
\frac{r}{s}=\iota(r)\,\iota(s)^{-1}.
\]

**Universal property (often used as the definition).**
If \(T\) is any commutative ring and \(\varphi:R\to T\) is a homomorphism such that \(\varphi(s)\) is a unit for every \(s\in S\), then there exists a unique homomorphism \(\psi:S^{-1}R\to T\) with \(\psi\circ\iota=\varphi\). It is given by
\[
\psi(r/s)=\varphi(r)\varphi(s)^{-1}.
\]

This perspective explains why [[algebra-commutative/localization-at-prime|localizing at a prime]] produces a [[algebra-commutative/local-ring|local ring]]: inverting all elements outside a prime ideal forces exactly those elements to become units.

### Examples
1. **Inverting a single integer.**
   Take \(R=\mathbb Z\) and \(S=\{1,2,2^2,2^3,\dots\}\). Then \(S^{-1}R\cong \mathbb Z[1/2]\), and \(2\) becomes a unit with inverse \(1/2\).

2. **Laurent polynomials by inverting a variable.**
   Take \(R=k[x]\) and \(S=\{1,x,x^2,\dots\}\). Then \(S^{-1}R\cong k[x,x^{-1}]\), and \(x\) becomes a unit. Its elements are Laurent polynomials because the denominators are powers of \(x\).

3. **Localizing at a prime ideal.**
   If \(\mathfrak p\) is a prime ideal of \(R\), set \(S=R\setminus\mathfrak p\). Then \(S^{-1}R\) is the [[algebra-commutative/localization-at-prime|localization \(R_{\mathfrak p}\)]], in which every element outside \(\mathfrak p\) becomes invertible.
