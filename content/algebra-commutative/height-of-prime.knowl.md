Let \(R\) be a [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative ring]] and let \(\mathfrak p\) be a prime ideal (i.e., \(\mathfrak p\in\operatorname{Spec}(R)\), the [[algebra-commutative/prime-spectrum|prime spectrum]]).

The **height** of \(\mathfrak p\), denoted \(\operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak p)\), is the supremum of integers \(n\ge 0\) such that there exists a strictly increasing chain of prime ideals
\[
\mathfrak p_0 \subsetneq \mathfrak p_1 \subsetneq \cdots \subsetneq \mathfrak p_n=\mathfrak p
\]
in \(R\).

## Equivalent characterizations

Equivalently,
\[
\operatorname{ht}(\mathfrak p)=\dim(R_{\mathfrak p}),
\]
where \(R_{\mathfrak p}\) is the [[algebra-commutative/localization-at-prime|localization at \(\mathfrak p\)]] and \(\dim\) denotes [[algebra-commutative/krull-dimension|Krull dimension]]. In particular, the dimension of \(R\) is the supremum of the heights of its prime ideals.

### Examples

1. **The ring of integers.**
   In \(R=\mathbb{Z}\), one has \(\operatorname{ht}((0))=0\), and for any prime number \(p\),
   \[
   (0)\subsetneq (p)
   \]
   is a maximal chain, so \(\operatorname{ht}((p))=1\).

2. **A polynomial ring in two variables.**
   In \(k[x,y]\) (for a field \(k\)), the prime ideals satisfy
   \[
   (0)\subsetneq (x)\subsetneq (x,y),
   \]
   so \(\operatorname{ht}((0))=0\), \(\operatorname{ht}((x))=1\), and \(\operatorname{ht}((x,y))=2\).

3. **Dedekind domains.**
   If \(R\) is a [[algebra-commutative/dedekind-domain|Dedekind domain]] (for instance, the ring of integers in a number field), then every nonzero prime ideal has height \(1\). In a [[algebra-commutative/dvr|DVR]], the unique nonzero prime ideal also has height \(1\), reflecting that these rings are “one-dimensional.”
