Let \(R\) be a [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative ring]].

\(R\) is **Noetherian** if it satisfies the *ascending chain condition* (ACC) on ideals: for every chain
\[
I_1 \subseteq I_2 \subseteq I_3 \subseteq \cdots
\]
there exists \(N\) such that \(I_n=I_N\) for all \(n\ge N\).

## Equivalent characterizations
The following are equivalent:
1. \(R\) is Noetherian (ACC on ideals).
2. Every ideal of \(R\) is finitely generated.
3. Every nonempty set of ideals of \(R\) has a maximal element under inclusion.

The equivalence of (1) and (2) is the most used in practice.

## Standard permanence properties
- If \(R\) is Noetherian and \(I\subseteq R\) is an ideal, then \(R/I\) is Noetherian.
- If \(R\) is Noetherian and \(S\) is a [[algebra-commutative/multiplicative-set|multiplicative set]], then the localization \(S^{-1}R\) is Noetherian; see [[algebra-commutative/localization-noetherian|localization preserves Noetherianity]].
- If \(R\) is Noetherian, then \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian (Hilbert basis theorem); a common formulation appears as [[algebra-commutative/hilbert-basis-corollary|Hilbert basis corollary]].

Noetherian hypotheses are the natural setting for finiteness results such as [[algebra-commutative/primary-decomposition|primary decomposition]] via the [[algebra-commutative/lasker-noether-theorem|Lasker–Noether theorem]].

## Examples
1. **Basic arithmetic and algebra.**
   \(\mathbb{Z}\) is Noetherian (every ideal is principal). If \(k\) is a [[algebra-rings/field|field]], then \(k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\) is Noetherian.

2. **Quotients and finitely generated algebras.**
   If \(R\) is Noetherian, then so is \(R/I\) for any ideal \(I\), and so is any finitely generated \(R\)-algebra of the form \(R[x_1,\dots,x_n]/J\).

3. **Localizations.**
   \(\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}\) (localization of \(\mathbb{Z}\) at the prime \((p)\), i.e. inverting all integers not divisible by \(p\)) is Noetherian by [[algebra-commutative/localization-ring|localization]] and the permanence above.

## Non-example
- The polynomial ring in countably many variables \(k[x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots]\) is not Noetherian: the chain of ideals
  \[
  (x_1) \subset (x_1,x_2) \subset (x_1,x_2,x_3) \subset \cdots
  \]
  never stabilizes.
