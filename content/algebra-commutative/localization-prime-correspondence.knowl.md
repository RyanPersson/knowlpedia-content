Let \(R\) be a [[algebra-rings/commutative-ring|commutative ring]] and let \(S\subseteq R\) be a [[algebra-commutative/multiplicative-set|multiplicative set]]. Write \(S^{-1}R\) for the [[algebra-commutative/localization-ring|localization]].

The map
\[
\mathfrak p \longmapsto S^{-1}\mathfrak p
\]
induces an inclusion-preserving bijection between:
- prime ideals \(\mathfrak p\subseteq R\) with \(\mathfrak p\cap S=\varnothing\), and
- prime ideals \(\mathfrak q\subseteq S^{-1}R\).

The inverse bijection is **contraction**:
\[
\mathfrak q \longmapsto \mathfrak q^c := \{\, r\in R : r/1 \in \mathfrak q \,\}.
\]

In other words, “primes survive localization exactly when they do not meet the set of denominators.” This refines the fact that localization [[algebra-commutative/localization-preserves-primality|preserves primality]].

## Geometric form

On the [[algebra-commutative/prime-spectrum|prime spectrum]], this correspondence identifies \(\operatorname{Spec}(S^{-1}R)\) with the subspace
\[
\{\,\mathfrak p\in \operatorname{Spec}(R) : \mathfrak p\cap S=\varnothing\,\}
\]
of \(\operatorname{Spec}(R)\). For \(S=\{1,f,f^2,\dots\}\), this subspace is the basic open set \(D(f)\); for a general multiplicative set it need not be open.

## Localization at a prime

If \(S=R\setminus \mathfrak p\) for a prime ideal \(\mathfrak p\), then \(S^{-1}R\) is the ring [[algebra-commutative/localization-at-prime|\(R_\mathfrak p\)]]. The primes of \(R_\mathfrak p\) correspond exactly to primes \(\mathfrak q\subseteq R\) with \(\mathfrak q\subseteq \mathfrak p\).

## Examples
1. **Inverting a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}\).**
   Take \(R=\mathbb{Z}\) and \(S=\{1,p,p^2,\dots\}\). Then \(S^{-1}R=\mathbb{Z}[1/p]\). A prime ideal of \(\mathbb{Z}\) meets \(S\) exactly when it contains \(p\), so the primes of \(\mathbb{Z}[1/p]\) correspond to \((0)\) and \((\ell)\) for primes \(\ell\neq p\).

2. **Localizing away from a hypersurface.**  
   Let \(R=k[x,y]\) and \(S=\{1,x,x^2,\dots\}\), so \(S^{-1}R=R_x\). Primes of \(R_x\) correspond to primes of \(k[x,y]\) that do not contain \(x\). For instance, \((y)\) survives, while \((x,y)\) does not.

3. **Localization at a maximal ideal.**
   In \(R=k[x,y]\), localizing at \(\mathfrak m=(x,y)\) gives [[algebra-commutative/localization-at-prime|\(R_\mathfrak m\)]]. Its prime ideals correspond to all prime ideals of \(k[x,y]\) contained in \((x,y)\), including \((0)\), \((x)\), \((y)\), \((x-y)\), and \((x,y)\).
