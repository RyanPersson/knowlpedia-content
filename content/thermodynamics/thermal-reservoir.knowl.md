A **thermal reservoir** (or *heat bath*) is an idealized part of the [[thermodynamics/surroundings-environment|surroundings]] that can exchange energy with a [[thermodynamics/thermodynamic-system|thermodynamic system]] **as heat** while maintaining an (effectively) constant [[thermodynamics/temperature-thermo|temperature]] $T_R$. Operationally, it is a macroscopic body with such a large heat capacity (and fast internal relaxation) that exchanging a finite amount of heat produces a negligible change in its temperature, so it stays in (approximate) internal [[thermodynamics/thermodynamic-equilibrium|equilibrium]] at all times.

Physically, a thermal reservoir models a very large environment (e.g., a large water bath, a laboratory “thermostat,” or an effectively infinite environment) that fixes temperature via the [[thermodynamics/zeroth-law-thermodynamics|zeroth law]]: when the system is placed in contact with the reservoir through a [[thermodynamics/diathermal-wall|diathermal wall]], it can relax toward [[thermodynamics/thermal-equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]] with $T = T_R$ (provided other constraints don’t prevent equilibration).

A reservoir is typically assumed to exchange *only heat* with the system (no matter transfer, and no controlled work transfer). If the coupling allows energy transfer as heat, the transferred amount is described by the [[thermodynamics/heat-inexact-differential|inexact differential of heat]] $\delta Q$.

**Key relations (constant-$T_R$ idealization).**  
Let $Q$ denote the net heat absorbed by the system from the reservoir over some interaction. Under the reservoir idealization, the reservoir’s entropy change is
$$
\Delta S_R = -\frac{Q}{T_R},
$$

because the reservoir remains at temperature $T_R$ while its energy decreases by $Q$.

Combined with the [[thermodynamics/second-law-thermodynamics|second law]], this yields a standard “system + reservoir” entropy balance:
$$
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_R
= \Delta S_{\text{system}} - \frac{Q}{T_R} \ge 0,
$$

with equality in the reversible limit (see [[thermodynamics/clausius-inequality|Clausius inequality]] and [[thermodynamics/reversible-process|reversible process]]). This is one of the main practical reasons thermal reservoirs are useful: they convert the second law into a concrete inequality involving $Q$ and $T_R$.

In statistical mechanics language, a thermal reservoir is what underlies the canonical description: the reservoir fixes the system’s temperature, equivalently fixing the [[thermodynamics/inverse-temperature-beta|inverse temperature]] $\beta = 1/(k_B T_R)$ with [[thermodynamics/boltzmann-constant|Boltzmann constant]] $k_B$ (see [[thermodynamics/canonical-ensemble-convention|canonical ensemble conventions]]).

Contrast: a [[thermodynamics/work-reservoir|work reservoir]] idealizes controlled exchange of work rather than heat.
