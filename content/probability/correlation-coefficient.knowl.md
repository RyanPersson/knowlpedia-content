A **correlation coefficient** is the normalized covariance \(\rho(X,Y)=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X)\operatorname{Var}(Y)}}\) for [[probability/random-variable|random variables]] \(X\) and \(Y\) with \(0<\operatorname{Var}(X),\operatorname{Var}(Y)<\infty\).

## Remarks

It is a dimensionless rescaling of [[probability/covariance|covariance]] and satisfies \(-1\le \rho(X,Y)\le 1\), with the sign indicating the direction of linear association. Correlation \(\rho(X,Y)=0\) means \(X\) and \(Y\) are uncorrelated, which is implied by [[probability/independence-random-variables|independence]] but is generally weaker.

## Examples

- If \(Y=aX+b\) with \(a\neq 0\) and \(\operatorname{Var}(X)>0\), then \(\rho(X,Y)=1\) when \(a>0\) and \(\rho(X,Y)=-1\) when \(a<0\).
- If \(X\sim N(0,1)\) and \(Z\sim N(0,1)\) are independent and \(Y=X+Z\), then \(\rho(X,Y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
- If \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent with finite, nonzero variances, then \(\rho(X,Y)=0\).
