Let \(K\) be a [[algebra-rings/field|field]] and let \(f(x)\in K[x]\) be a separable polynomial of degree \(n\) (equivalently, \(f\) has distinct roots in an [[algebra-fields-galois/algebraic-closure|algebraic closure]]; see [[algebra-fields-galois/separable-distinct-roots|separable ⇔ distinct roots]]). Let \(L\) be the [[algebra-fields-galois/splitting-field|splitting field]] of \(f\) over \(K\). Then \(L/K\) is finite, normal, and separable, hence [[algebra-fields-galois/galois-extension|Galois]] (see [[algebra-fields-galois/separable-normal-galois|separable + normal = Galois]]).

**Theorem (factorial bound).** If \(f\) is separable of degree \(n\), then
\[
[L:K] \le n!.
\]

## Remarks

One conceptual proof: separability gives \(n\) distinct roots in \(L\), and the [[algebra-fields-galois/galois-group|Galois group]] \(\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\) acts faithfully on this set of roots, yielding an injective homomorphism \(\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)\hookrightarrow S_n\). Using [[algebra-fields-galois/galois-degree-equals-group-order|degree = group order]] for finite Galois extensions gives \([L:K]=|\mathrm{Gal}(L/K)|\le |S_n|=n!\).

A useful refinement: if \(f=\prod_i f_i\) with \(f_i\) separable and \(\deg(f_i)=d_i\), then writing \(L_i\) for the splitting field of \(f_i\), one has
\[
[L:K] \le \prod_i [L_i:K] \le \prod_i (d_i)!,
\]
since \(L\) is contained in the compositum of the \(L_i\).

### Examples

1. **Sharp bound for a cubic.**
   Over \(\mathbb{Q}\), \(f=x^3-2\) is separable of degree \(3\). Its splitting field is \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},\zeta_3)\), and \([L:\mathbb{Q}]=6=3!\).

2. **A quartic with smaller degree than \(4!\).**
   For \(f=x^4-2\in \mathbb{Q}[x]\), the splitting field is \(\mathbb{Q}(2^{1/4}, i)\), which has degree \(8\), far below \(24\).

3. **Product of quadratics.**
   For \(f=(x^2-2)(x^2-3)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]\), the splitting field is \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2,\sqrt3)\) and \([L:\mathbb{Q}]=4\), matching the refined bound \((2!)(2!)=4\).
