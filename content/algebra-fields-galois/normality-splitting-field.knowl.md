Let \(K\subseteq L\) be an algebraic [[algebra-fields-galois/field-extension|field extension]]. The following are equivalent:

1. \(L/K\) is a [[algebra-fields-galois/normal-extension|normal extension]].
2. For every irreducible \(f(x)\in K[x]\) having at least one root in \(L\), the polynomial \(f\) splits completely into linear factors over \(L\).
3. There exists a set \(S\subseteq K[x]\) such that \(L\) is the [[algebra-fields-galois/splitting-field|splitting field]] of \(S\) over \(K\). If \(L/K\) is finite, one may take \(S=\{f\}\) for a single polynomial \(f\in K[x]\).

## Remarks

In particular, finite normal extensions are exactly finite splitting fields (up to \(K\)-isomorphism, cf. [[algebra-fields-galois/splitting-field-uniqueness|uniqueness of splitting fields]]).

### Examples

1. **Quadratic extensions are normal.**
   \(L=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt2)\) is the splitting field of \(x^2-2\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\), hence \(L/\mathbb{Q}\) is normal.

2. **A non-normal cubic.**
   \(L=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\) contains one root of \(x^3-2\) but not the complex roots \(\sqrt[3]{2}\zeta_3\), \(\sqrt[3]{2}\zeta_3^2\). Thus \(x^3-2\) does not split over \(L\), so \(L/\mathbb{Q}\) is not normal.

3. **Finite fields as splitting fields.**
   For \(L=\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\) and \(K=\mathbb{F}_p\), the polynomial \(x^{p^n}-x\in K[x]\) splits over \(L\) with roots exactly the elements of \(L\). Hence \(L/K\) is normal (and in fact [[algebra-fields-galois/galois-extension|Galois]]).
