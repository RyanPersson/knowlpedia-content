Let \(G\) be a group, let \(k\) be an algebraically closed field (e.g. \(k=\mathbb C\)), and let
\[
\rho: G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)
\]
be a finite-dimensional [[algebra-representation-theory/irreducible-representation|irreducible representation]].

## Corollary of [[algebra-representation-theory/schurs-lemma|Schur's lemma]]
If \(z\) lies in the [[algebra-groups/center-of-group|center]] \(Z(G)\), then \(\rho(z)\) is a scalar operator:
\[
\rho(z) \;=\; \lambda_z\,\mathrm{Id}_V \quad \text{for some }\lambda_z\in k.
\]

More generally, if \(a\) lies in the center \(Z(k[G])\) of the [[algebra-representation-theory/group-algebra|group algebra]], then the \(k\)-linear operator “action by \(a\)” on \(V\) commutes with \(\rho(G)\) and hence is also scalar on \(V\).

### Consequence: abelian groups have only \(1\)-dimensional irreps
If \(G\) is [[algebra-groups/abelian-group|abelian]], then every \(g\in G\) is central, so every \(\rho(g)\) is scalar. If \(\dim(V)>1\), every line in \(V\) would be \(G\)-stable, contradicting irreducibility. Hence any irreducible representation of an abelian group over \(k\) has \(\dim(V)=1\).

## Examples

1. **\(C_n\).**
   Since \(C_n\) is abelian, every irreducible complex representation is \(1\)-dimensional. Concretely, if \(C_n=\langle g\rangle\) and \(\zeta=e^{2\pi i/n}\), the irreducibles are the characters
   \[
   \chi_j(g)=\zeta^j \qquad (j=0,1,\dots,n-1).
   \]

2. **\(D_8\) (order \(8\)).**
   For the dihedral group of the square, the center is \(Z(D_8)=\{1,r^2\}\) where \(r\) is rotation by \(90^\circ\). In the \(2\)-dimensional “geometric” irreducible representation on \(\mathbb C^2\), \(r^2\) acts as rotation by \(180^\circ\), i.e.
   \[
   \rho(r^2) = -I,
   \]
   a scalar operator. In every \(1\)-dimensional representation, \(\rho(r^2)=+1\) (also a scalar, necessarily).

3. **\(S_3\).**
   \(Z(S_3)=\{e\}\) is trivial, so the corollary imposes no nontrivial scalar constraints—consistent with the existence of a \(2\)-dimensional irreducible representation.
