Let \(G\) be a finite group and let \(k\) be an algebraically closed field with \(\operatorname{char}(k)\nmid |G|\), for example \(k=\mathbb C\). Let
\[
\{V_1,\dots,V_r\}
\]
be a complete set of pairwise non-isomorphic finite-dimensional [[algebra-representation-theory/irreducible-representation|irreducible representations]] of \(G\) over \(k\), and write \(d_i=\dim_k(V_i)\). Then
\[
\sum_{i=1}^r d_i^2 \;=\; |G|.
\]

## Regular-representation form

Equivalently, the underlying \(kG\)-module of the [[algebra-representation-theory/regular-representation|regular representation]] decomposes as
\[
k[G]\;\cong\;\bigoplus_{i=1}^r d_i\,V_i,
\]
and taking dimensions gives \(\dim_k(k[G])=|G|=\sum_i d_i\dim(V_i)=\sum_i d_i^2\).

This decomposition follows from [[algebra-representation-theory/maschkes-theorem|Maschke's theorem]], which makes \(k[G]\) semisimple, together with multiplicity computations using [[algebra-representation-theory/schurs-lemma|Schur's lemma]].

## Examples

1. **Cyclic group \(C_n\).**
   Over \(\mathbb C\), every irreducible representation of \(C_n\) is \(1\)-dimensional (a character). There are \(n\) such characters, so
   \[
   \sum_i d_i^2 \;=\; \underbrace{1^2+\cdots+1^2}_{n\text{ times}} \;=\; n \;=\; |C_n|.
   \]

2. **Symmetric group \(S_3\) (order \(6\)).**
   \(S_3\) has irreducible degrees \(1,1,2\) (trivial, sign, and the \(2\)-dimensional standard representation), hence
   \[
   1^2+1^2+2^2 \;=\; 6 \;=\; |S_3|.
   \]

3. **Dihedral group \(D_8\) (symmetries of a square, order \(8\)).**
   \(D_8\) has four \(1\)-dimensional irreducibles and one \(2\)-dimensional irreducible, so
   \[
   4\cdot 1^2 + 1\cdot 2^2 \;=\; 8 \;=\; |D_8|.
   \]
