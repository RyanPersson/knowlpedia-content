Let \(f:(X,d_X)\to(Y,d_Y)\) and let \(a\in X\).
We say \(f\) is **continuous at \(a\)** if for every \(\varepsilon>0\) there exists \(\delta>0\) such that for all \(x\in X\),
\[
d_X(x,a)<\delta \quad\Rightarrow\quad d_Y\!\bigl(f(x),f(a)\bigr)<\varepsilon.
\]

## Examples

- \(f(x)=x^2\) is continuous at every \(a\in\mathbb{R}\).
- The step function \(f(x)=\mathbf{1}_{(0,\infty)}(x)\) is not continuous at \(0\).

## Remarks

If \(f\) is continuous at every point of a set \(A\), then \(f\) is [[real-analysis/continuity-on-a-set|continuous on \(A\)]].

In metric spaces, \(f\) is continuous at \(a\) if and only if \(x_n\to a\) implies \(f(x_n)\to f(a)\).
