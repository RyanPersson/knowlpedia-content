**Jordan canonical form theorem**: Let \(T\) be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space \(V\) over an algebraically closed field \(k\) (more generally, assume the characteristic polynomial splits over \(k\)). Then there exists a basis of \(V\) in which the matrix of \(T\) is block diagonal with blocks of the form \(J_{m}(\lambda)\), where \(\lambda\) ranges over the {{< knowl id="eigenvalue" section="linear-algebra" text="eigenvalues" >}} of \(T\). Each Jordan block corresponds to a chain of generalized {{< knowl id="eigenvector" section="linear-algebra" text="eigenvectors" >}}, and the multiset of block sizes for each \(\lambda\) is uniquely determined by \(T\) up to permutation.

In this form, \(T\) is {{< knowl id="diagonalizable" text="diagonalizable" >}} exactly when all Jordan blocks have size \(1\). The sizes of Jordan blocks are governed by the primary decomposition of the \(k[x]\)-module associated to \(T\), and can be derived from the {{< knowl id="minimal-polynomial" section="linear-algebra" text="minimal polynomial" >}}; one route is through the {{< knowl id="rational-canonical-form-theorem" text="rational canonical form theorem" >}}
