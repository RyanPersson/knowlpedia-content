A **graded module** over a graded ring \(R=\bigoplus_{n}R_n\) is an \(R\)-{{< knowl id="module" text="module" >}} \(M\) together with a direct-sum decomposition
\[
M=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb Z} M_n
\]
(as an internal {{< knowl id="direct-sum-modules" text="direct sum" >}} of abelian groups) such that \(R_i\cdot M_j\subseteq M_{i+j}\) for all \(i,j\). A homomorphism of graded modules is typically required to preserve degree (or have specified degree shift).

Graded modules are the natural linear objects over a {{< knowl id="graded-ring" text="graded ring" >}} and encode “homogeneous” algebra in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

**Examples:**
- Any graded ring \(R\) is a graded \(R\)-module over itself, with the same decomposition \(R=\bigoplus R_n\).
- If \(R\) is graded and \(I\subseteq R\) is a homogeneous {{< knowl id="ideal" section="algebra-rings" text="ideal" >}}, then \(R/I\) is a graded module (and graded ring) with \((R/I)_n = R_n/(I\cap R_n)\).
