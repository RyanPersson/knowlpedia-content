title: "Direct sum of modules"
description: "The coproduct of modules: tuples with finite support under coordinatewise operations."

Given a family of $R$-{{< knowl id="module" text="modules" >}} $(M_i)_{i\in I}$, their **direct sum** is the set
\[
\bigoplus_{i\in I} M_i=\{(m_i)\in \prod_{i\in I} M_i : m_i=0 \text{ for all but finitely many } i\},
\]
with coordinatewise addition and scalar multiplication. It is naturally a submodule of the {{< knowl id="direct-product-modules" text="direct product" >}}, which itself is modeled on the {{< knowl id="cartesian-product" section="analysis" text="Cartesian product" >}} of sets.

The direct sum is characterized by the {{< knowl id="direct-sum-universal-property" text="universal property of the direct sum" >}}: maps out of a direct sum are uniquely determined by maps out of each summand, subject to finite support.

**Examples:**
- For a finite index set, $\bigoplus_{i=1}^n M_i$ is the same as $\prod_{i=1}^n M_i$.
- $\bigoplus_{n\ge 1}\mathbb Z$ consists of integer sequences with only finitely many nonzero entries.
- (Edge case) If $I=\varnothing$, then $\bigoplus_{i\in I} M_i$ is the zero module.
